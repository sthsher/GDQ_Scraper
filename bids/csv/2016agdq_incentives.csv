This makes the final boss fight a pushover typically, requiring very little effort and ending very quickly. And thanks to the Fierce Deity Mask&#39;s beams it fires from its sword, hitting the boss blind is not a problem. For this reason, ending the co-op run with all 4 players coordinating together on one controller while blindfolded is not only safe, but would be an appropriate and hilarious way to do so.","$7,575.24","$7,500.00"

Crash Bandicoot was nerfed heavily during development for this same reason, but there is a prototype version that has level layouts that are considerably harder than anything that made it into the final game. Sunset Vista is one the hardest levels in the game and is even harder in the prototype, which is why I selected it as the incentive.","$4,004.28","$4,000.00"
