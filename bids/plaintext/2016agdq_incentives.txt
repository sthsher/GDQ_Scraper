Incentive: Save Block Storage Glitch
Game: Paper Mario
Description: Save Block Storage Glitch demonstration after the run (possibly with Stryder7x). Paper Mario has some great glitches used in runs but even crazier glitches that are not very useful in runs, and this glitch is one of the best. Through the use of save block storage, the game state gets extremely distorted, preventing Mario from getting into encounters but more importantly storing actions such as using springs and pulleys. Once a few springs and pulleys are stored, the glitch can be cancelled, flinging Mario in a hilarious way, and ends with a softlock.

Incentive: Blindforded Co-op Majora Fight
Game: The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#39;s Mask
Description: The 100% category has the added advantage of both the Fierce Deity Mask from collecting all the masks in the game and an exceedingly large amount of health thanks to 20 hearts with the double defense upgrade by the time it reaches the end of the game. This makes the final boss fight a pushover typically, requiring very little effort and ending very quickly. And thanks to the Fierce Deity Mask&#39;s beams it fires from its sword, hitting the boss blind is not a problem. For this reason, ending the co-op run with all 4 players coordinating together on one controller while blindfolded is not only safe, but would be an appropriate and hilarious way to do so.

Incentive: Beta version of Sunset Vista
Game: Crash Bandicoot
Description: The incentive would be to complete the Beta version of Sunset Vista. In 2014 we had an incentive for Stormy Accent, a level that was removed from the final version of the game due to its excess difficulty. Crash Bandicoot was nerfed heavily during development for this same reason, but there is a prototype version that has level layouts that are considerably harder than anything that made it into the final game. Sunset Vista is one the hardest levels in the game and is even harder in the prototype, which is why I selected it as the incentive.
