But it was AWESOME watching some of these unbelievable and epic feats pulled off LIVE! The glitches, the 100%s, the commentary, all of it. I&#39;ve spent hours watching and I was more than happy to give again and again. Thank you. PS. Next year do Takeshi no Chousenjou! (NES)

Perhaps after an hour we can create our own good ending. I hope I&#39;m not too forward, but if I am, just let me know so I can reload my save state and try a different route. Just kidding!

Congratulations on another successful sdsa marathon. I have seen both of your marathons. Alluding to Mike&#39;s previous comments about a marathon in the summer, I think it is a great idea to have some sort of mini-marathon, because these marathons are, for some viewers, one of the more anticipated forms of entertainment of the year.

I love watching video game streams all the time, but your stream has been by far the most meaningful and most fun to watch stream I&#39;ve watched!

Hey everybody, thank you so much for doing this again. It&#39;s programs like yours and Relay for Life that are really making a difference. There have been so many cool games that you&#39;ve run, and unfortunately I&#39;ve missed a few of my favorites. I want to shout out to my friends in the Embodiments of Stuff. I hope to see you all on Ustream defeating cancer with your Pokemon, Ground Pounds, Screw Attacks, Spells, Swords, Guns, and Portals.

I wanted to say a big thanks to everyone who participated. I know you guys all make personal sacrifices including financial sacrifices to make this happen. I have been coming to SDA since 2004. I&#39;d love to see a race in rygar or zelda 2. Highlights were chorus of Katamari, to the piano (FF music during battletoads final boss was pure awesome), sm64 1 star, and of course the OoT race . If I had more money I would donate it. One point of information - it is in fact YOU guys who are all the mans!! -Angus

As promised, $1256 for the 6:25 or better Chrono Trigger run. As tempted as I am to put this donation towards naming Edward &quot;Bieber,&quot; such a move would condemn me to a very deep part of hell. An even deeper part than I&#39;m already going to, for first donating to have someone smack Carcinogen in the back of the head (despite the fact that he&#39;s an awesome guy), and then making float jokes (despite the fact that Essentia can fire back my own amusing live-run gaffes at me). So I think instead that I&#39;ll just use this donation to share my thoughts and feelings. Over the past five days, I have had the privilege of listening to stories that many people have shared with me. Many of those stories were sad ones: stories of friends and family members, whose lives were cut short by a horrible disease. You and your families have been in my heart for these past five days. Know that you have not only my thoughts and hugs, but those of everyone attending and watching this marathon. But, over these past five days, I&#39;ve also heard another kind of story. Stories of hope -- of an uncle, a sister, a daughter, or a father who beat cancer. Each one of those stories is a single ray of hope, that taken together blaze like the sun. Your stories have warmed my heart. Your stories are the reason that someone I&#39;ve never had the pleasure of meeting phoned me from the other side of the continent at four in the morning, to tell me to get back to the marathon. Thank you for sharing this hope with me. I&#39;ve read that groups of people, from a neighbourhood to a nation, rise to accomplish great things when they face challenges that meet both of two conditions: the challenge is shared by everyone in the group; and, the group feels that they can actually overcome the challenge through action. From the stories that people have shared with me, it is clear that we face a shared challenge. Everyone loves someone who has battled this disease. But, what&#39;s more is that we know that we can overcome this challenge! The Pokemon screen-capture declaring that SDA defeated cancer was not just an idle joke; rather, it captured the sentiment and the passion of all of us, to overcome cancer. And that is why we have accomplished something amazing here, from the amazing runs produced by the runners, to the amazing donations raised by thousands of perfect strangers who came together for this fight. To everyone involved in planning and running this marathon, and to everyone who donated: thank you. For me, this has been a marathon of fun and joy. It has been a marathon of laughter. Sometimes, it has been a marathon of tears and sadness. But, above all, it has been a marathon of hope. Hope for a future in which there are fewer stories to be shared about cancer. Hope for a future in which more of the stories shared about cancer are stories of success. To everyone who has helped to make that future a reality, you have my most heartfelt gratitude. All the best, --Ryan &quot;Poxnor&quot; Vogt

To all SDA members and everyone involved with making this event a reality, thank you so much. My father is a survivor of cancer and it means so much to me that you have done this event and raised almost 50,000 for this charity! You are truly an inspiration to us all. I also want to say that I have been following SDA for years now and it has been my homepage on my browser ever since I stumbled upon it, around the time you branched out from Quake. I have been a spectator up until now but i hope to make my own speedrun someday, and maybe even attend one of your events next year.

$10 for some background Thriller dancing during Lavos&#39; final form. Also, my donation for Kain being named Enhasa seemed to garner some unexpected hating, so I&#39;d like to explain/defend: While Enhasa may be gone, you know that he&#39;s always on your side, able to be returned and strike down again with his knowledge and insight. Also, at the time I bid, I had heard that someone had bid to name Cecil after their grandfather; memories of grandfather outweigh memories of a highschool friend and one of the best RPG players I&#39;ve known. After the adverse reactions, I&#39;ll not try to outbid for an Enhasa character.

$15 for Chrono Trigger goodness (the best JRPG of all time), current-day JRPGs may be all but dead, but CT proves the genre wasn&#39;t always terrible. I&#39;m totally amazed at the ammount that SDA has raised for such a great cause. Looking forward to Seeing Dalton getting his just desserts!

Just want to thank Essentia for running Chrono Trigger while sleep deprived...also, provided I can make it to next year&#39;s marathon (and I&#39;m gonna try like hell to make that happen), perhaps I should challenge her to a race of Final Fantasy VI...however seeing as that was run last year, we could pick another equally good RPG. I&#39;m open to suggestions for this. PS: count this $5 toward naming the Epoch &quot;88MPH&quot;

Thank you so much for what you&#39;re doing, for what you have done. Let&#39;s make cancer a distant memory, something you read about in the history books, like smallpox or scurvy. I eagerly anticipate the next charity marathon event! Also, I&#39;m looking forward to the videos being posted so that I can finally watch everything I couldn&#39;t catch live.

Good morning SDA. First, I&#39;d like to thank Denton, who is awesome! Second, I would like to place two last donation pledges on this game, one of my favourites in the marathon. My pledge is for SDA timing (game time until final save + rounded real time until final hit on Lavos Core): - If Essentia beats the current 100% time of 6:31 (that is, if she gets a final time of 6:30 or less), I will donate $631. - If Essentia gets a time of 6:25 or less, I will donate an additional $625 (for a total of $1256). (Note that I&#39;ll be gone for the ending of CT; I&#39;ll donate around 3pm EST. I&#39;m not bugging out. I&#39;ll just sadly miss the ending of CT.). Cheers --Poxnor

Although I can&#39;t claim credit for discovering any of them, it&#39;s still awesome to see all these cave story tricks performed in real time, instead of TAS. Speaking of which, it&#39;d be great if you guys could give a run down on the relationship between the communities of TASvideos and Speed Demos Archive.

Anyways, its been beyond awesome hanging out, I wouldn&#39;t trade being a part of SDA for anything in the world. I can&#39;t possibly shout out to everyone who I owe something to right now, so I&#39;ll just say props to the poor sap who&#39;s stuck manning dmanag at the moment; the program title is still &#39;Test&#39; by the way :P.

Blade cutter supremacy! Yo-yo comes close though. Thanks for the great runs. Super Mario 64 was especially amazing. This goes for Gourmet Race, then Arena, if the amounts haven&#39;t been met yet.

I thought about betting on her, but I thought, why not just donate in advance rather than leave it up to chance. Good luck to MercuryZelda against VG. I&#39;m a bit late with this, but I really loved the castle crashers run. Why? Because of all the Jman puns. This isn&#39;t enough for the lead, but I hope people like it. So, with that in mind, I have a name for FuSoYa: Luney.

I also wanted to give mad props to Jayman for the KH2 cocommentary during Axel&#39;s run.

This will probably be the last time I donate so allow me to say a few things: (1) This marathon proves that SDA is all about making things bigger and better; way to go guys!! (2) Much thanks should go to Nate in advance for syncing and posting this marathon later as I&#39;m sure it&#39;s going to be a ton of work. I watched last years many times. And (3) this is the third time I&#39;m donating for naming Yang as &quot;Frezy&quot; and nobody will tell me what he&#39;s at!! Anyways, way to go, SDA, for defeating cancer!!

Unfortunately, this is going to be my final donation for this year. I&#39;ve spent way more time watching than I could afford but you guys put up a great show. Big shoutout to nate and LagDotCom for handling the technical aspects of this marathon so well and to everybody else for a very entertaining weekend. I wish I could watch the rest of the event but real life is intervening. I really hope to make it next year, I regret not going this time. Keep up the great work and shoot for $50k. Also, put this towards Marle being named Elmo.

Hey Nate, you may not remember me, but this is Eternalspirit from the forums. I know this is a small donation but I felt compelled to also thank you for helping me with some of my noob questions on the forums as well. I know you handle stuff like that probably on a daily basis, but all the little things that you do with the community definitely don&#39;t go unnoticed. Thank you again for all your hard work on our new forum and the continual work you do on it and all the other little things that might get lost behind the scenes. It was definitely a step in the right direction, and I&#39;m looking forward to a great future for SDA.

You are combining my two loves - medicine and games. It&#39;s great to see people utilizing games to do good things. Go positive work! I am an avid gamer and also a faculty member at a school of pharmacy and medicine. I have had several family members die of cancer, and recently several more diagnosed with various types. Currently dealing with a cancer scare among some close friends as well. Keep it up, and kick some ass.

First, congrats to UltraJMan for the most awesome Metroid finish EVER. Second, this is to Super Mario 64 120 Stars, because as much as I love Majora&#39;s Mask, the 120 Star run is more fun to watch. Third, this is also personal--my Aunt came down with ovarian cancer years ago, and it was extremely severe. Thankfully, she recovered, but it was still terrifying and she is scarred emotionally. Hope that this helps research for a cure!

You guys are doing awesome work for a great cause. BTW in return for this donation NESkamikaze has to do a front flip (IRL) as soon as run is over, on stream. Yes, he can do it. Also, if possible, please put this toward the SM64 120 star run.

It is a pleasure to cheer you on in Rondo and to continue to cheer you on in SoTN... Can&#39;t wait to add more games onto SDA hopefully and to do more than just have a speed run on Megaman powered up... BTW, if you and I make it to the marathon next year, would you consider a megaman powered up Race? Best of luck! Mike Sol P.S. Mario 64 to hopefully calm the runner...

Feel free either to announce it or keep it quiet, as you like: - If he does not die to the first goomba, $100 - That will rise to $150 if he gets over the first pit (either by jumping over it or taking a pipe to avoid it) - That will rise to $250 if he completes World 1-1 Cheers :) --Poxnor

Excellent job and great commentary - especially the MGS1/2 runs, Carcinogen and Cody knocked them out of the park even after the bad start. Count this as a donation for Super Mario 64 120-star. Mike can also read this if he (you?) wants or something I don&#39;t know: &quot;Look down, back up, where are you? You&#39;re in front of a computer, watching a stream of speedruns for charity. What&#39;s on the screen, back at me, I have it. It&#39;s a speedrun of that game you love. Look again, the speedrun IS NOW DIAMONDS. Anything is possible when you donate to the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Romscout&#39;s on a couch.&quot; (...bottlegreen_fly shamelessly recycles her edited memes)

Hello again from the exotic world of South Wales. Had to renew my status as &quot;The Man&quot; :p I was really bummed that I missed the resident evil runs and Mega Man 9 run. I&#39;m saving some money back for the Majoras Mask bidding war. I think a full mask completion would be way more impressive than a 120 star run. Any idea when the videos of the runs will be uploaded, really wanna watch those resi runs :0 All the best! PS Earthworm Jim race and SotN tri race are going to be OFF THE HOOK!

10 dollar for X in X4. Can&#39;t stand Zero, would be awsome if he just said &quot;Zero, Zero, Zerooo&quot; then he would be a good pok\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9mon. Awsome marathon.

To the SDA Community: To begin I would like to thank you for hosting this marathon once again this year. I caught the first portion of it at Magfest last year but was unable to view the remainder due to...well magfest. In either case its good to see speed runs being done for a good cause. As a result of my donation I humble request (if possible) if Kirk &#39;BioSpark&#39; LaBuda could 1% Metroid Fusion. I understand if this is a bit much but it would be greatly appreciated. In either case look forward to seeing you guys at Magfest this year. Best Regards, Panda

Enjoy your hard work guys, keep it up! Even if Halo was 2 hours delayed, still bad ass skills! Quick Question for Resident Evil 4. It says New Game + on Professional. So it&#39;s not a brand new game with just pistol, first aid, and ammo and small case? Appreciate your passion! P.S. All your base belong to us

Raffle: A donation of $5 enters a ticket into all the raffles, correct? If you win one raffle are you eliminated from the rest, or can you donate another $5 to enter again? Are you entered multiple times for multiple donations? Thanks if you answer. Also, might consider putting the specifics under the raffle info on the website so you don&#39;t have to repeat it. = )

Glad I was able to donate for this one. There are a few games I am looking forward to seeing like portal and TMNT 4. I hope you can surpass your goal.
