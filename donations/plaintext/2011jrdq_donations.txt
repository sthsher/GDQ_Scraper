I just sent a previous donation of %100, but I screwed up sending a comment I think. If I did, here it is again. Put this money for Earthbound. Just as we all wish to make Japan safe, I wish to help stop Giygas. Therefore, I donate my $100 asking to name u00e2??James Rodriguezu00e2?? for the player name. You know, when they ask you a few times and you get to put in a long name. However, if the player of the game has an issue with this, then put my money in for Jeff to be named James.

from runner &quot;duckfist&quot;: Thanks to our viewers and SDA personnel (ROMSCOUT) for making this marathon a reality. Japan, responsible for pioneering most of the modern video game industry that we are familiar with, deserves the world&#39;s support. Games such as Mega Man and Mario were a wonderful part of my childhood, and it&#39;s great to see so many others lending their support. Please keep the donations coming, and show your support to SDA by registering and contributing. Thanks everyone.

(pronounced: Steven Sunberg) Good luck with the marathon. I loved AGDQ. If it&#39;s not too early this is for 4 VVVVVV trinkets. I want to see someone destroy Veni Vidi Vici and Edge Games live.

God Hand is so awesome that couldn&#39;t resist donating some money. Hopefully I can keep donating more on coming days.

5 dollars towards Silver in Sonic 06. Also, is anyone thinking of speedrunning Streets of Rage Remake v5 for any of the next marathons? That&#39;d be a GLORIOUS run.

I think it&#39;s super impressive that you organized this marathon so quickly, especially so soon after AGDQ. Keep up the awesome work! Please put this towards an extra for Lego Harry Potter.

Another great marathon incoming! Starting off good with God Hand, my favourite Clover game, and ending with MGS and MGS2, YESPLZ! Can&#39;t wait for La-Mulana! Keep being nerds to the end, I love you for that.
