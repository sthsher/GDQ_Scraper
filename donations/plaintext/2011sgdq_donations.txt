Hey all, seeing these moments makes me sad I&#39;m not there in person. But it also makes me happy that you&#39;ve made such a successful marathon without my help. I enjoyed seeing some familiar faces and some new breakout stars. Everyone seemed to get along and mesh well together - I could tell from the commentary. There were a lot of classic moments - Pies were thrown, people declared they were the wind, chicken rulings were made, and so much more, but it&#39;s all coming to a close. I&#39;m glad people have donated so generously to support the Organization for Autism Research, and that they shared their personal experiences with Autism. The community participation is a big part of what makes these mararathons great. I wish I could have donated more for my final donation, but I probably donated too much for my bank account to handle already. If the summer marathon happens again (it better), I&#39;ll try my hardest to come there next year. -Mike P.S. You can throw this in for Bronanassentia

Great Metroid race! Here&#39;s my donation for a chance to win that plushie or pearler. And I agree with romscout in that if you save the animals, they have nowhere to go because they&#39;re planet is kind of gone. By saving them, you&#39;re dooming them to a miserable vagabond life. Let the animals die. It&#39;s their time.

There&#39;s been a lot of talk lately about 25th Anniversaries, especially this year, with Legend of Zelda, Castlevania, Dragon Warrior, and Rygar. However, TODAY, is the 25h Anniversary for the original Metroid. That&#39;s something worth celebrating for speedrunners everywhere.

3rd Donation towards the new goal of $20,000. Putting my $10 in for a shot at the glass Triforce and defeating autism. Excellent play on all fronts and congrats on the quick kill on Blind. Power went out for 30 seconds and between rebooting and reloading I missed most of the first 4 dungeons in the Dark World, a true speed run. Good luck to all and btw its a chicken sandwich or fillet, not a burger.

You guys should be discussing less &#39;petty&#39; things than the &#39;patty&#39; versus &#39;burger&#39; thing. (Get it?) It&#39;s clearly &#39;burger&#39;. If you think differently, you don&#39;t know anything about video games.

So put as much of this $20 as needed towards that, and the rest towards Mirror&#39;s Edge Weaponless. Here&#39;s to a world where we have a better understanding of Autism.

Kubelwagon is quite the crafty player, and his interfacing with the game is giving me a stitch in my side.

Just to be overly technical, I&#39;d consider Sonic CD to actually be Sonic&#39;s first real foray into 3D, at the special stages. Sonic 2&#39;s special stages are close to 3D as well, but you can only move in two directions.

Donating because of the fantastic commentary for the TAS. As a software engineer, it&#39;s rare to hear accurate discussion of programming and system architecture during a game marathon. From a fellow nerd, kudos. And for my own clarification, you&#39;re saying that on some games, memory would be accessed with trash data or data from previous executions?
