Hey, this has been my first Games Done Quick, and it&#39;s been absolutely awesome! In fact, it has me considering speedrunning myself.\r<br /> <br />I had intended on running Chrono Trigger, but then found about Essentia&#39;s and Inichi&#39;s runs on SDA... Trying to improve on those will be hard, unless those crazy TAS memory corruption strats can be done in an RTA.\r<br /> <br />Anyway, cheering on Essentia in this FFVI race.

Saerdna stopping in to say &quot;yay&quot; for not missing this run, was able to get my friend to watch since we were talking about this earlier this month.\r<br /> <br />Obadjr, haven&#39;t been in channel for a while, but still watch the races when I can.\r<br /> <br />Love the Chibi-ssentia enthusiasm and now that my weekend has started I can catch up on streams! Careful though, as SpikeVegeta found out, Obadjr, she might &#39;got this&#39;.

The marathon was awesome!\r<br />I always love the bonus stream, I hope that there will be another Mario Party like last time. Also, probs to Blueglass for once again being present at nearly every speedrun.

Put this toward any prizes that are still available, maybe something mario or zelda related.

One day, I&#39;ll run a game on that couch in Summer Games Done Quick... only because I am a teacher so that&#39;s when I&#39;m off. Once again, good work!

Hey everyone. Found out about the SDA marathons earlier this year during AGDQ 2013 and have enjoyed watching this marathon as well. These marathons have really sparked my interest to get into speed running and I hope to make it to a marathon one day, if for nothing else than to have a great time with a great community. Looking forward to bonus stream, even if I lose more sleep because of it.

Hi all! I meant to donate during the GTA runs, but the donation button broke *sad face*and this is the first chance I have had to donate since. This is the first SDA Marathon that I I&#39;ve managed to catch live and it&#39;s been nothing buy mind-blowing the whole way through! I used to speed run years ago and brings a tear to my eye to see many of my personal best times completely shattered live by these runners. Here&#39;s my $25 to help get a no-clip cheat for those doctors to get passed those pesky borders.

I&#39;m missing the &quot;Doo Doo Doo&quot; Squad and so this donation is to keep myself from going insane from homogeneous second-order linear constant coefficient partial-differential equations, aka the Laplace Equation, by having whoever is holding Reimu right now has to be Mofat&#39;s cheerleader for the next boss fight.

Well, it&#39;s the TP run! This is my 4th and final donation of the marathon. This was a great weekend, and it was an absolute joy to watch. Bonesaw, I&#39;m so glad to see you on that couch, because your Luigi&#39;s Mansion run was a work of art and a privilege to see live; you&#39;ve certainly earned this follower. Zoast&#39;s incredible Super Metroid run and hand-work was brilliant and ended up being one of my favorite runs of all the marathons. I now have so many runners to follow, and I can&#39;t wait to see what you all can do in the future. Congratulations to everyone there for another successful marathon, and we&#39;ll see you next mission!

I got into speedrunning after finding speeddemosarchive on one of those websites that links you to random websites when you&#39;re bored. I have yet to break a world record for a game but I&#39;m working on it. I didn&#39;t realize how inviting the speedrunning community was, and how great the runners are until I watched cosmo do a RBA OOT run at AGDQ. It&#39;s convinced me to start streaming my runs and hopefully someday get asked to be a participant. I wanted to thank all of the members of the community for getting me into a fantastic and rewarding hobby.

This is the 4th marathon I was able to watch, but the first that I&#39;m donating for. Even though I can&#39;t donate that much as I&#39;ve no job, I&#39;m glad I can at least give this much.\r<br /> <br />Stay classy and speedy, everyone!

Fez Paladin here once again...\r<br /> <br />I am ever so happy to hear you guys say that the CameCube version of Twilight Princess is superior to the Wii version! Thank you so much for bringing it up! Technical issues aside, the reversed map on the Wii version is disorienting and I have no idea why the developers thought that a right-handed link couldn&#39;t finish the game on the normal map... could anyone here shed some light on this for me?\r<br /> <br />Also, will Mofat go through the Cave of Ordeals? I do it just for fun, but I don&#39;t know if that counts in this run or not.\r<br /> <br />Again, thanks for the CameCube props! :)

Hey there you blokes.\r<br />I only got to watch the last run of the night, but I was releived to see it&#39;s one of the few Zelda games I haven&#39;t seen a run of. Best of luck to Mofat and may Farore bless teh urn.\r<br />I think speedrunning livestreams and their community is a prime example of the what the internet can do, and it given no credit for. Much love from the Wooten brothers.\r<br />Also, I can&#39;t tell if that&#39;s Cosmo back there, but I&#39;d liike to personally thank him and his band of crazy magical madmen for founding SRL, as well as tell him to Raise his Donger on behalf of the 420 Dong Squad. Much love.\r<br />Put me in for the 3DS XL.

Let me just say to everybody at SGDQ: Thank you all so much for this fantastic marathon, especially the people behind the scenes keeping everything running smoothly. It&#39;s great to see people having fun not only with the speedruns themselves, but also seeing everybody in the chat making jokes about games, discussing games, and most importantly, coming together to help others, all in the name of video games. You guys are all doing a great service to our hobby and as long as you guys keep putting on these marathons, I will keep donating. It&#39;s also my birthday today, so if I could get some of those July 29th birthday shoutouts it would be much appreciated!

Hey guys,\r<br /> <br />I watched AGDQ 2013, which was an amazing experience! Thank you guys for all you do.\r<br /> <br />I missed most of the runs this time around because it snuck up on me so quickly. <br /> <br />But what I have seen is amazing!\r<br /> <br />Thank you guys for all you do. I started running Majora&#39;s Mask Any% myself after AGDQ 2013. It is a lot of fun and hard to do! <br /> <br />This can go to whatever Spikedvegeta wants.\r<br /> <br />Have fun!

Hey guys, LLK here. My first donation was for a dollar, might as well make my last donation a dollar as well.\r<br /> <br />I&#39;ve had a blast watching you guys tear these games asunder. Those video games were all &quot;blaarrghh I have an intended route that you must follow!&quot; and you guys were like &quot;NO! NOW WATCH IN HORROR AS I SNAP YOUR SPINE IN TWAIN!&quot;\r<br /> <br />I have a lot of other stupid stuff to say, but I already have my speech saved for the end of the marathon. Until then, I&#39;ll just enjoy watching Twilight Princess being stomped into a thin paste. Also, Brossentia, if you ever visit me, you are FORBIDDEN from using the stairs.

This is my $2 challenge to all 33,000+ of you watching this feed right now. If each of you donate $2 that would be $66,000. Skip tomorrow&#39;s coffee and save lives instead! A lonely $2 won&#39;t do much, but 32,000 $2 can change lives! Let&#39;s get to $300K people!

So, don&#39;t read this out loud, but I have donated 4 times over the course of the marathon and not a single one of them has been read. I haven&#39;t written anything vulgar or offensive. I would just like to know why my donations aren&#39;t being read. I don&#39;t have a lot of money, but I have donated what I can and it would be nice to be able to hear them on-stream. An explanation would be appreciated.

Hey Vibex here, I&#39;ve been watching almost non stop (except for some internet problems), and wanted to show my appreciation. Seems like it&#39;s a little to late to kill the animals, so I guess I&#39;ll just put it towards the Melee Finals.

I may have been joking the majority of this weekend, but what I&#39;m saying now is no joke. You all are the most generous, hilarious, and overall epic group of people I ever had the fortune to see. I wish I was more involved with a cause and community like this, so I WILL be attending AGDQ 2014 to show my support in person.\r<br />Put this last donation to everyone in the room shouting out: AROOOOOOOO! Or to Mofat&#39;s choice.\r<br />See you all in 2014!\r<br /> <br />Radman the Lucario~

Hey, I noticed my $10 from last night for &quot;Kill the Animals as Best Final Fantasy&quot; was never added to the list. (The donation was read aloud during Mario 64.) If I donate $20 more will you please add it in? One of the choices on the list only has one cent.

And to all the Bronies who are watching live: come on, now! Anything below first place will not suffice for AppleJack! You of all people know this. So let&#39;s raise that amount!\r<br /> <br />P.S.

Its a public service that everyone gets stuff from. 2. There are more people who work it nights than days. 3. Whoever deals with the prizes after the marathon will deal with it. If no can guess then the money goes to the readers choice. The answer is the Post Office.

Hi everyone at SGDQ! <br />Just wanted to say I think you are all amazing. As a person who needs to go to the hospital three times a week, I love how you all run these events for people who are truly in need. I know the people who receive this money genuinely appreciate it, and are very thankful for the time and dedication you all have put into these events.\r<br />Much &lt;3 to all of you.\r<br />May the based speedrun gods be with you all

BlueberryPi here, giving my last few British pounds to you guys. Great FFIV run so far. Major shoutouts to mike89 and the rest of the IRC crew that have kept me company during this (almost) sleepless marathon. Quick question to everyone there, have any of you played or hear of Rolo to the Rescue on the Mega Drive/Genesis? I&#39;m thinking of starting to run it this year.\r<br /> <br />These pennies to Brossentia&#39;s choice.

SteveTheDreamer here. I am sad to say I havn&#39;t been able to follow the speedrun community very much this past year, the main reason being because I have been working a LOT. But the plus side to that is I actually have more money to donate at the marathons now.\r<br />It is comforting to know you all are still at it, and once again raising money for a great cause by demonstrating exceptional skills across so many great ( and awful ) games. All of you are, and forever will be, a HUGE inspiration to me and countless others. May you all find as many 1-UPs as your hearts&#39; desire.

But people are curious the VIDEO is up on youtube.\r<br /> <br />I just want to state, that glitch is probably why my cart is ruthless to me, and constantly trolls.\r<br /> <br />About the MVluck, I had the original bad NPC luck! Don&#39;t believe me? Refer back to AGDQ&#39;11, and i&#39;m sure they are the same troll NPCs :P Good luck Brossentia!

Hi everyone! FFIV is one of my favorite games, if for no other reason than the FANTASTIC initial English translation. Great game, great run, great cause! Ten bucks to Mac, and ten to Cheese.\r<br /> <br />Shoutouts to that plush octopus!

Was distressed to hear I missed AGDQ... but thankfully I&#39;m here for this one! Much excitement.\r<br /> <br />Pretty hype to see some final fantasy four that isn&#39;t one of the creepy overdone remakes! <br /> <br />Donation to Mac And Cheese (or runner&#39;s choice... you know... if he feels like deviating from his goals.)

It&#39;s my first time donating so I&#39;m not sure how things work here. I saw AGDQ videos on youtube and when I found out about SGDQ, I got hype. Put this money towards Twilight Princess file name Cosmo. Hopefully I can participate in another GDQ running Tales of Vesperia. Good Luck to all runners, also can the reader come on screen to say hi?

Hey guys. It&#39;s my 30th birthday today and although it sounds lame, a speed run of my all-time favorite game, Final Fantasy IV is as good a birthday present as any I have got, or will get. I&#39;ll be staying up later than normal to watch this one. Thanks for everything.\r<br /> <br />-DJ

It&#39;s time for upt Co! For those not in the know, this will become clear near the end of this run. Good luck to Brossentia. Hi to Essentia, Celise, and Laurelyn! I know it might not make much of a difference at this point, but let&#39;s try to get Essentia for Rosa&#39;s name. I would&#39;ve gone with Kraden for Tellah, but the gap is a bit large on that one.

Hey guys,\r<br /> <br />no need to read this out loud. I only just tuned in to the dropping frames and have a suggestion:\r<br /> <br />- In case the sound is fine but the pictures are dropping (like just before), you could throw in a Q&amp;A section to bridge the not-running to keep the viewers hooked.\r<br /> <br />- Yagamoth\r<br /> <br />ps: Put this towards what you want

If the rest of my comment is mistaken in my assumption, discard it and put this towards diehard%.\r<br /> <br />If I&#39;m not mistaken, there is no name for Edge in FFIV in the tracker. Unless I don&#39;t know something about the run, I&#39;d like to nominate a name. A very close friend of mine had always liked Edge, and when we were younger thought him among his favorites in the series. Lately he&#39;s had hard times in his life, and I can&#39;t pass the chance up to do him a good turn, as he has done me many more. For him, I give all I have left to nominate the name &#39;Syeniel&#39;. No one call poxnor, just this once. Thank you all for the wonderful marathon, and best of luck to everyone going forward.

I just noticed that Edge doesn&#39;t have a name yet on the list! =O Unless someone there already has plans for naming him here&#39;s $10 to name Edge in FF4 as Magikarp [as Mgikrp] because he was neglected for so long and I feel it&#39;d be appropriate! XD If there&#39;s already a planned name for Edge then put this towards naming the horse in Twilight Princess &quot;Applejack.&quot;

Donating for some awesome speedruns and a great charity!\r<br /> <br />Please put my monies towards giving the ff4 DieHard% appropriate music. I don&#39;t know what a DieHard% run entails, but something tells me it&#39;ll be a lot of fun finding out.

Here&#39;s a hint on how to pronounce my name: <br />Yoast (like Toast but with a Y) van Ah May Rung en. 10 more $ if you managed to pronounce it.\r<br />This is my first live Marathon, my brother started hyping it for me the day after AGDQ, that bastard. <br />All 10$ towards SpikeVegeta ruining his voice doing Gilgamesh. <br />Going to count the amount of times I hear &quot;I got this&quot; this Rayman Origins run and donate again accordingly. Go nuts!

So this is it, my tenth and final donation for SGDQ2013, bringing my total donations to three hundred dollars. I thought it fit to place my final donation while Braid was being run, as it was the very first speed run I ever saw, the run that started the obsession. Shoutouts to all the runners, staff, and volunteers for their amazing work bringing this marathon to life and and all that they are giving to such a wonderful charity. Although I&#39;ve lurked for quite a while, I finally made an account on the SDA forums, so look foward to maybe seeing a run from me sometime soon. I hope to see you all in person at a AGDQ or SGDQ in the future! Many thanks from the land down under, Lachlan, A.K.A. mystery_editor

Just woke up a bit ago, so while I haven&#39;t seen most of the run, good luck anyways, Marche. Also want to wish xfullmetal17 good luck on his Braid run coming up in a little over an hour from now. Really looking forward to seeing it, since I did the Braid run at AGDQ earlier this year. I was glad to see that his in-game best got close to my AGDQ time, so here is hoping he gets the sub-40 realtime. Looking at the list of choices and challenges, wow there really isn&#39;t much left, is there? Let&#39;s go ahead and boost Tellah&#39;s name to be Kraden by just a little more, since I love the Golden Sun reference.

What&#39;s the guy with the hat on the couch&#39;s name so I can follow him on Twitch?\r<br /> <br />I heard Trihex is a streamer, but does he even stream any more ha?\r<br /> <br />This donation goes to Bonesaw&#39;s choice though because I really liked his Luigi&#39;s Mansion run and his personality. However, he has to comment on as much as possible for this run because Twitch chat hates it. Umad chat?\r<br /> <br />Keep it hype.\r<br /> <br />- Garm993\r<br />

I was wondering if I could get whoever is in the room to unanimously agree on a game you&#39;d like to see be ran, and I&#39;ll do it. Gotta get in on AGDQ 2014 somehow! Also, Spikevegeta, how&#39;d it feel when your Hype Girl stole the spotlight on your DKCR run at the beginning of the Marathon?

Sadly, I missed Super Metroid, but I&#39;ll be sure to catch it when the footage is available later. Is there any interest among the runners in modded versions of Super Metroid, like Ice Metal or Super Zero Mission? I just recently discovered that there is a modding community for Super Metroid and their work is fascinating.\r<br /> <br />Put this towards whatever the mysterious box where you write things to be read wants.

Ive been absolutely in love with SMW since i played it the first time. In the era without readily FAQ&#39;s and internet chats, this was the first game I 100%&#39;ed and it felt amazing. Maybe took me about 2 years to find the secret place above the waterfall. Regardless, I am so happy to see this game being played and ran, and I thank you guys for doing the world a great service. One question for Go1den, whats your fastest &quot;killed bowser&quot; time? as in beating SMW but not 100%&#39;ing it, With and without glitches? (if there are any glitches, im new to the speedrun community and this event has got me motivated :) )

Sup SGDQ. Posted earlier but didn&#39;t hear my name, maybe I missed it. Anyway, keep up the good work and can&#39;t wait to see Dark Souls and Dustforce along with about 10 other titles today. Bid goes to SpikeVegeta. Still loving the Reimu plush and...I guess wish me luck in taking down that Bounty Hunter, Aran.

Since my first donation is still &#39;comment pending approval&#39; I said I&#39;d donate 5 bucks for every YUMP. Here&#39;s keeping good on that. Please put this towards the courtesy coin because I&#39;ve marked this down as 5 red splits in a row and it will give me bingo.

Third time&#39;s the charm!\r<br /> <br />Edward von Stein here, donating around two games that made up most of my childhood, SMB being just a few month older than me, and my mother having literally mastered SMW. Of course I also want a chance at reliving my past of playing SMK with that shiny SNES.\r<br /> <br />...granted my cartridge of Super Mario Kart was horribly glitched to the point that all drivers would randomly teleport around the track at all times. So it was no surprise suddenly finding yourself out of bounds so far you couldn&#39;t see the map... or suddenly found yourself teleported literally into the final round. It was weird as awesomeness.\r<br /> <br />Anyways, thanks all of y&#39;all for holding this marathon, and for putting it to a great use. <br />Put this donation to whatever the first person to go &quot;It&#39;s-a me, Mario!&quot; wants. Thank you all, and a shout out to whoever from the library watches!

I was expecting the 5-min run of SMB, but I think the full run is actually more impressive. It&#39;s awesome to see the gaming community get together for good causes.

Hey guys, I love watching speed running. Ive been amazed since watching AGDQ from last year. Since then Ive been mostly watching Cosmo and a few other streamers. Ive been practicing a little bit on a few games to try speed running. And it truely amazes me how you guys can do all these amazing tricks almost effortlessly. So mad respect. Btw Cosmo, cant wait for you to get back to Windwaker to get sub 4:30. From your subscriber Helixux.

Hey, first time ever watching speedruns for real. Good to see you guys doing what you&#39;re doing, using your speed-running intellect to raise paper for charity. Would love to see Starcraft at some point if anyone there has the mettle to run it!

Anyways, I wish I could donate more but you stole all of my money already and converted it to pizza. Put this 10 dollars towards naming the horse in Twilight Princess to be Bonerfart.

It&#39;s another SGDQ so here&#39;s another donation. All the runs have been awesome and I especially needed to show some support during siglemic&#39;s run. Here&#39;s 10 dollars I scrapped up from skipping on buying lunch at work all week. Also, my friend recently beat Dark Souls as a level 1 pyromancer. Here&#39;s to hoping for a level 1 speed run of dark souls in the future. Please speed runners out there, make this happen!

Hey, I&#39;ve been watching this throughout the last few days, and now that I have some dough I feel it is right to put it towards a great cause.\r<br />Eight years ago I survived a brain tumor, in large part thanks to the great doctors of the UCLA Medical Center. However, if I was from somewhere less fortunate in the world who knows what would have happened to me, which is why I feel this is a great fundraiser for Doctors Without Borders, so that way those who suffer similar problems can also get the help they need as I once did. Good luck over the rest of the speed runs!

For a couple of species with a spaceship, they should be smart enough not to get trapped on an exploding planet!\r<br /> <br />Also, if Zoast is made to save the animals, he will most likely lose the world record by one second, in which case all you who though saving them would be a good idea will not be able to sleep at night and you will feel bad.\r<br /> <br />The animals must die to bring balance to the Force! If they live, this run of Metroid will not be so SUPER!

I hope one day I can reciprocate as much knowledge back as I have received.\r<br /> <br />Put my $5 towards making sure the animals are killed. I&#39;m hoping that like a bug squashed in the jurassic period; it&#39;ll somehow alter the future canon; and Other M may never take place.\r<br /> <br />Good luck again Zoasty; give Crocomire the bad touch.

Why can&#39;t Metroid crawl?\r<br /> <br />Watching you speed right through this is absolutely crazy, and it reminds me of the last time I played it and managed to not escape the lab at the beginning.\r<br /> <br />This makes me want to try again. I bought it for thirty cents on the Wii U, and it&#39;s a good excuse to give it some use.\r<br /> <br />You&#39;ve earned a ton of money since I started watching and you&#39;re all doing great.

Hello again, SDA! Greetings from Brazil!\r<br /> <br />As a nearly graduating Med student, I cannot express in words how much joy it brings me to see such a fantastic way for gamers to help people in need, entertain other games, and be generally awesome in every aspect of the word. <br /> <br />So I&#39;ll say simply: Thank you so much, and keep being what you are! I can only hope I can find as much joy in my profession and touch as many lives as you do through your marathons.

Love what you guys are doing, keep up the great work. Super Metroid is one of my all time favorite SNES games. To decide where my 20 goes, flip a coin 4 times. For each heads put 5 dollars on save the animals, for each tails 5 dollars on let them die.

Me again, fulfilling the deal as promised! Reminder that this goes to Siglemic&#39;s choice.\r<br /> <br />Poor Siglemic. I made that request because my friend Claudia (aka Hayate) is a huge Siglemic fangirl and I&#39;m watching the run with her. I wanted to make her squee, and lo and behold, she did. Her reaction to him going through with that was, and I quote, &quot;Now I must find the timestamp when it&#39;s archived and show it off to everyone!&quot;\r<br /> <br />All joking aside, I do some Let&#39;s Plays, and someday I aspire to speedrun some of the favorites I&#39;ve done in the past. Unfortunately, this is mostly the Battle Network MegaMan subseries, which is at the &quot;unmolested&quot; stage in terms of being broken for speedruns, though the Network Transmission game has an existing speedrun.\r<br /> <br />Oh well.

First time watching a speed run marathon although I have been a speed run fan for a while. Applejack for horse name because she is best pony. Also save the animals. <br /> <br />On a more serious note it is amazing what all of you speed runners are doing here today. What was simply a hobby for you all initially has become a cause for the better good. Don&#39;t discount your efforts for a moment, you are all the living proof that gamers are much more than society tries to make us seem.

Great event guys. Been watching since yesterday morning and haven&#39;t turned it off. I&#39;m hoping to win that 1.0 cart because watching jadin play my favorite zelda game is making me want to get into speed running. Great job and let jadin decide where the money goes. either kill the animals or save them.

Hey guys and gal(s)! This is a great thing you&#39;re doing. Not only is what you&#39;re doing relentlessly entertaining, its also for a great cause. One question though: why isn&#39;t the donation total displayed on the stream? I love seeing that number slowly (well, quickly) and steadily climb.\r<br /> <br />P.S. Just wanted to say that I put this towards Twilight Princess File Name: Cosmo! I&#39;m sad that he isn&#39;t running Wind Waker this marathon, but was happy to see him run Castlevania.

Every time Siglemic gets a Star we drink. Every time Siglemic falls we drink. Every time he utilizes a glitch we drink. Every time he takes damage we drink. Happy streaming and hopefully some fellow viewers join in with us!!

I&#39;ve been watching speedruns for a while now, but this is my first time donating to a marathon like this. It seems only right since it goes towards such a great cause. I got my girlfriend hooked on this and we&#39;ve both been waiting to donate until the Link to the Past run in hopes of winning either the N64 or the SNES. Put this towards killing the animals in Super Metroid since we gave those stupid things a lucky break during AGDQ. Good luck to all the runners! From Rolan and Alyssa.

This was my comment for a $10 and a $1 donation that got skipped: <br /> <br />This $21 goes towards BlueGlass and iateyourpie&#39;s Old Man River duet. They&#39;re going to have to work out a contract for the iTunes royalties as it&#39;s surely Grammy-bound. <br /> <br />Donation incentive suggestion: $1000 for BlueGlass emote on Twitch chat. <br /> <br />Onward to Cosmo OoT $150,000! <br /> <br />By the way, the most Twitch viewers that I&#39;ve seen on the stream is 46k+. You guys should be tracking/screenshotting that.\r<br /> <br />Shout outs to David &quot;shoo way&quot; Chen, Go1den, and everyone I met at MagFest XI this year!

Hi everyone do not worry about the name, but if you made a good effort I&#39;ll donate again as a reward. And since I&#39;m setting challenges I will donate (before the end of the run) for every time AdamAK says &quot;You&#39;re welcome Cosmo&quot; every time he catches himself messing up. <br /> <br />Big shoutout to my brother for getting me hyped for this marathon the day after AGDQ, this is my first marathon and I&#39;m loving every minute of it.\r<br /> <br />Here&#39;s 10 for V-Rock!

This is a great way to raise money for a good cause. Keep doing what you&#39;re doing.

Hello, my name is Connor. I watched your live commentary of your pokemon leaf green. I am a huge fan of pokemon and still play even at the age of 17. Let me say that you do not know how to play. I&#39;m just saying you are not meant to play these games. My advice, use your party pokemon and level them all up together. You then can beat any trainer and gym out there. I&#39;ve played every single pokemon game and I know what I am talking about. Thank you for your time. <br />Sincerely, Connor B. <br /> <br />

The first time I played the original Pokemon generation, the only Pokemon I used was Squirtle/Wartortle/Blastoise because I had no idea what to do within the game. This Leaf Green run is reminding me about that first play through. Thanks for providing for a great cause throughout the world. I know this isn&#39;t much, but it&#39;s what I can afford while unemployed. Please put this $10 to saving the animals.

I discovered AGDQ for the first time earlier this year and it was one of the most fun things I&#39;ve been involved in, even if &quot;involved&quot; is just watching and donating, and so I was quite excited when I found out that there was another one during summer. I will definitely be watching these every year from now on. I couldn&#39;t decide what to bid towards, so put this on catching up on saving the animals. (By the way, it&#39;s pronounced the same as &quot;gosh&quot;.)

Hey, everyone! This is my second donation of the marathon because Pokemon FireRed / LeafGreen are my favorite games in one of my top 3 gaming series! I&#39;m sad that it&#39;s impractical to run this game with Alakazam, my favorite Pokemon. I&#39;ve been looking forward to this run all weekend, and I hope that the RNG gods smile upon you, Mex; get all of the crit hax! And, let&#39;s hear that TV; I&#39;ve never watched it before, and would love to see it.

Pokemon is a great game, but it doesn&#39;t have nearly enough animal murder! Gonna have to look forward to Super Metroid for that, I guess. Watching them get knocked out in fights just isn&#39;t the same.\r<br /> <br />And speaking of animal battles, answer me this: who would win in a fight? Deer Force or Wolf Team?

The work of a speedrunner is a kind of sorcery, a remaking of the game developer&#39;s original intent into an entirely new experience through engine exploits and shortcuts. Your dedication gives such tired terms as artisan and specialist new life. For these reasons, and because of your cooperation with Doctors Without Borders, you guys deserve massive respect. I am donating for Rydia vs. Rydia because one Rydia is never enough.

Hello, had to donate during the Double Dragon run. Being a developer myself, I can appreciate that watching your own game being torn apart like this, can be somewhat of a mixed back, when runners do things to it, you just didn&#39;t anticipate. So props to the DD developers for doing this. Great marathon, looking forward to the rest of it.

A couple months ago I had never even heard of live speed running. One day I randomly stumbled upon a twitch stream where some guy named PJ was scientifically deconstructing Super Ghouls and Ghosts in the most amazing fashion for his audience. The next time I caught him broadcasting was the Fab Four marathon; needless to say, I was hooked! Thank you for introducing me to this community PJ, may the debt collector have mercy upon you.

Baby Moses Perler hype! Would put this five dollars towards Save The Animals (They should not suffer from Other M!) But would much prefer to put it to a new one - getting Naegleria to join in that Pie/Blueglass Duet (Or Trio, rather!) I heard that little song-like intro he gave last rollcall, and it sounded lovely. &lt;3

Hey guys,\r<br />Fourth donation and I&#39;ve got to say: money well spent, much better than spending it on Steam&#39;s Summer Sales.\r<br />Love watching PJ&#39;s runs, as well as everyone else&#39;s runs, so in honour of the dynamic duo, please let PJ choose where 10$ of this donation goes, and mecha richter gets to choose where the other 10$ goes.\r<br /> <br />And so she doesn&#39;t feel left out, Essentia gets to pick where the last 10$ goes.\r<br /> <br />Keep up the great runs,\r<br />-Rob\r<br /> <br />PS: PJ is batman, mecha richter is robin. Essentia is the best final fantasy :)

Hey Meta, it&#39;s Vajuralla, made sure to be up for your SoE run, but I gotta say it&#39;s weird to see you run it without resetting thirty or forty times. Put my thirty to anything you want, and here&#39;s hoping for that boxed copy. Also you&#39;ve been pronouncing my name wrong since I started watching you on twitch, it&#39;s pronounced &quot;vajra&quot;, and I spell it weird on purpose. Much flex to you sir!

Hey, guys. Had to donate a bit more because I&#39;m really looking forward to the Secret of Evermore speed run. That game reminds me of the great scene from the movie Captain Dirk versus the Space Wombats. Dirk was hiding in a giant molehill when he commandeered a space freighter, saying &quot;I may have hid in the dirt, but now it&#39;s time to touch the stars!&quot;\r<br /> <br />Putting this donation towards Spikevegeta as Gilgamesh.

My friend only recently introduced me to speedrunning streams but I&#39;m hooked.\r<br /> <br /> I have been watching the marathon off and on due to work, but from what I&#39;ve seen this Final Fantasy V run has been the most entertaining. Shout out to everyone in the room for sticking it out and providing all the great laughs.\r<br /> <br />Good luck with the rest of the marathon.

Wanted to donate during Puwexil&#39;s run. Watching his stream inspired me to try out speedrunning rpg&#39;s, specifically FF7 since it was the first rpg I ever beat the final boss and one of my favorite games of all time. I found out about AGDQ shortly after AGDQ 2013 ended and I&#39;ve watched almost all of the vods for the past two years of marathons. Really excited to finally watch one live and I hope one day I might be good enough to join you guys.

Probably won&#39;t be able to finish the rest of the FFV run, but I still would like to donate for this portion. I&#39;ll donate more as the marathon progress. I&#39;d like to put this money down for naming Zapdos &#39;Murica! instead of America! since everyone&#39;s now calling it that way. If not, let Reimu Plushie decide where it goes to.

First time donator, though I&#39;ve been a huge fan of SDA marathons for quite some time. Wish I could donate more, but my wallet bled dry thanks to the steam summer sale. Major props to what all of you do for such a great cause! Puwexil, your FF9 run at AGDQ was EPIC, and I must say this one is definitely shaping up to be equally awesome. Kind of glad you&#39;re playing the SNES version of FF5, PS1 Pirate Faris is...well...interesting. Put this 5 dollars towards killing the animals in super metroid! Apologies to the reader for having to pronounce my name. ((ps. it&#39;s pronounced Yah-sna, and then a silent d for Djopar.)) <br />Keep up the good work! :)

Spikevegeta, how&#39;d it feel to have your Hype Girl steal the show on your DKCR run at the start of the Marathon?

I&#39;m brand new to watching speed runs, and MetaSigma was the first channel I really watched. He and his fans really made me feel welcome! After being blown away by his post-World Record SoE flexing-- I must see more!

I was just thinking about buying a repro cart of FF5 from Timewalk as you were talking about the repro cart prize. Here&#39;s another $10 to get me in the running. This brings my total so far to $50. Thanks for the late night RPG running Puwexil and thanks to everyone for supporting SGDQ!

Important problem, Mike, it&#39;s me ShyRanger. Since you&#39;re in charge of donations, can you please look into this problem with my file on the donation tracker. I mentioned it before but never got a response from the reader.\r<br /> <br />Everytime I make a small donation, like $5 to $20, my total donations for the marathon raises like $2000 and number of donations went up by about 100. For example, my last donation of $5 caused my total to raise from $12,000 to $14,000 and number of donations went from 398 to 498. And now it&#39;s even higher\r<br /> <br />If I click on the file, the amount of donations and total is accurate, and it&#39;s also accurate if I check All Events instead of this event. So it might just be this event&#39;s tracker being weird. But I want to make sure so I don&#39;t lose thousands of dollars of money I don&#39;t have.

Best Couch Crew NA too, though its odd to see Essentia with a Final Fantasy without her daughter cheering it on.\r<br /> <br />Money goes to the Meta Flex, though I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;d do it anyway. The donation incentive should have been &quot;Make Meta play without a shirt&quot;, though frankly, that&#39;s likely to happen sometime during the run, too.

You got this bro and thanks for all of the time spent helping me pick this game up to the great level I have been. <br /> <br />Essentia, can you please forgive me?! for all of the trolling and the fun i got out of inserting myself into your runs. But mostly thank you so much for giving me the ropes to pick up 6, now I just need to learn to apply it!\r<br /> <br />Alas, i&#39;ve dragged on!

Hey luigimeister here. Still a tad salty about that Mario Party Pie, we need a rematch. 20 bucks go to D Oak as the trainer name. Nobody forget about D Oak for trainer name, and ESD for starter. It&#39;s important to have the Trifecta.

Nanoline here again. Paper Mario has been one of my favorite games growing up, and I always felt assured of it&#39;s endurance and stability.\r<br /> <br />And then like usual for these marathons, my childhood dreams were shattered in a few moments of control-stick-shaking shenanigans.\r<br /> <br />Regardless, putting $10 to saving the animals, because killing them wouldn&#39;t get rid of Other M sadly, it would just keep that travesty and rob us of the rather fun Fusion.

Loving all the runs so far, I will ever stop being amazed. I would love to thank Cosmo for introducing me to the speed running community but now all other forms of entertainment is too slow for me. Let Cosmo decide where this goes for giving me the gift and curse of speed run watching. Also SpikeVegeta , I love your voice.

Paper Mario was one of my favorite N64 games back in the day--oh the memories. I love the game&#39;s sense of humor, and I&#39;ve really been looking forward to this run. I had no idea that there were apparently so many glitches in the game, so this should be most entertaining. Put these 10 bucks towards Pie wearing someone else&#39;s hat because... uh... variety!

\xe2\x80\x9cI will shoot at him\xe2\x80\x9d said the cyberdemon and he fired the rocket missiles. Peaches plasmaed at him and tried to blew him up. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.\r<br />\xe2\x80\x9cNo! I must kill the demons\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\r<br /> <br />The radio said \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Peaches. You are the demons\xe2\x80\x9d\r<br />And then Peaches was a zombie.

Shout out to my friend Ray Narvaez Jr for getting me into watching speed runs.\r<br /> <br />It&#39;s unfortunate that the bid war for the Paper Mario file name got cancelled, but hey it was worth a shot. I mean, YOLO, right?\r<br /> <br />If possible, I would like to redistribute the $10 I donated earlier to the Paper Mario file name. $5 towards the Sicko/Siglemic Super Mario 64 race, and $5 towards killing those animals. They must have done something to deserve it!\r<br /> <br />This donation, as always, is in memory of David Dreger. Rest in peace, my friend.

Hi everyone. Bisqwit here. Cool charity you are collecting for. Unfortunately I will be away when my favourite games from this marathon will be played -- especially Final Fantasy V --, but hopefully I can watch them in an archive later.\r<br />Put this towards the dog&#39;s name suggestion for Secret of Evermore: Idefix (ee-de-fix).

As a lifetime id Software fan, nothing is better than seeing their games in a marathon, especially a lesser known one like Doom 64. Here&#39;s to hoping Doom 4 makes an awesome speedrun someday. Let Peaches choose where this donation goes for being such a hardened space marine.

Metroid: Destroyer of my fifth grade test scores! Great speedrunning going on here. Dragondarch can choose how to spend this.\r<br /> <br />Also, question for the runners: Is it different to run the Famicom Disk System version of Metroid?

I&#39;m watching as much as I can, because I always want to support the marathons and their beneficiaries. Making my first donation during the Metroid block because the series is one of my favorites; I even wrote a 20 page philosophy paper on it! Good luck to all the runners, and save all the frames as you can; we&#39;ll do our part and save all the people we can!

HUGE problem with my list of donations in the tracker.\r<br /> <br />Can somebody handleing the donation tracker please look into this problem? <br /> <br />Everytime I make a small donation, like $5 to $20, my total donations for the marathon raises like $2000 and number of donations went up by about 100. For example, my last donation of $5 caused my total to raise from $12,000 to $14,000 and number of donations went from 398 to 498.\r<br /> <br />If I click on the file, the amount of donations and total is accurate, and it&#39;s also accurate if I check All Events instead of this event. So it might just be this event&#39;s tracker being weird. But I want to make sure so I don&#39;t lose thousands of dollars of money I don&#39;t have.

Loving the Zelda block even though I am super sick with a stomach bug. Also super hyped for later games. Sleep heals you when you&#39;re sick? Bah! Video games are better, and maybe some of these doctors I keep hearing about can come heal me instead. :)

2 Questions: Can the grand prizes be entered over multiple donations? Or does it have to be one big donation? 2nd question: Can the entire audience pat their head and rub they stomach at the same time for 15 seconds for 20 dollars? And if I can still use the money, make it go to runners choice.

Thank you for another fantastic marathon of speed running and races for good causes! Great fun watching the Ninja Gaiden races and remembered why I want to pick up a copy of Crystalis.\r<br /> <br />Please put $5 towards Zoast handcam in Super Metroid and $5 towards Feasel&#39;s choice. I&#39;m learning great things about Zelda 2 during his run, and he deserves it. Keep up the good work!

NES games hype! Good luck feasel as well as the upcoming racers. I&#39;m gonna root for UA in the Crystalis race, no offense to Dragondarch but I&#39;m sure UA will give him a good race. I may as well cement my name being the second filename choice for that race.

SGDQ viewers for greediest philanthropists of 2013?\r<br />2) Put this towards saving the animals - They need not suffer just for Other M!\r<br />3) Shoutouts to BlueberryPi as most empathetic chat member - Twitch won&#39;t get this, those on SDA chat will! :3

Hello darkness, my old friend,\r<br />I&#39;ve come to talk with you again,\r<br />Because a vision softly creeping,\r<br />Left its seeds while I was sleeping,\r<br />And the vision that was planted in my brain\r<br />Still remains\r<br />Within the sound of silence.\r<br /> <br />In restless dreams I walked alone\r<br />Narrow streets of cobblestone,\r<br />&#39;Neath the halo of a street lamp,\r<br />I turned my collar to the cold and damp\r<br />When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light\r<br />That split the night\r<br />And touched the sound of silence.

15 more bucks because I feel like throwing cash around for good causes. More donations to come! <br /> <br />Let Omega decide where this should go to, as long as there&#39;s no animals involved. :D\r<br /> <br />Also, A big shoutout to the guy/guys that does the highlight and blooper-reels after each marathon. Keep up the good work! It&#39;s greatly appreciated and I look forward to it after each and every Marathon. Thanks a lot!\r<br /> <br />// Emil Svensson!\r<br />

Amazing job with the record, Toufool. I had no idea this game was so broken. Really looking forward to Paper Mario. Also, I want to thank Trihex for his support of the SSBM community back in February, even though he is a dirty liar and still owes me a shirtless, full-game run of Yossy&#39;s Island. <br />Sincerely, <br />$100-sama\r<br /> <br />PS, put this towards &#39;Old Man River&#39;

In his honor, I would like to request a new donation incentive: the file name for Paper Mario to be &quot;Knuckles&quot;.\r<br /> <br />Rest in Peace, David. You were like an older brother to me.

From Bonafide\r<br />&quot;As its name implies, duck fist is another form of imitative boxing. The duck fist fighter waddles instead of walking. Yet this strange footwork conceals devastating kicks. The arms flap as well, which can be applied as defensive techniques similar to the styles of Crane fist.&quot; Waddling is pro strat.

The Black Sigma, Maverik King of the Robot Dark Empire, has extended the world of darkness and weakened the power of Dr. Light whose wisdom has guided the world of science for generations.\r<br /> <br />The 16th Crimson Dr. Light 4th entrusted his two infant sons, X and Zero, to his faithful servant Alla. The three escaped the forces from another dimension in the hope to bring light back into the world.\r<br /> <br />The next 17 years were difficult but X, Alla, and Zero devoted themselves to the cause of Holy Robot Justice. The Black Sigma had further extended his empire over the countryside and the interdimensional forces were even more powerful. X needed to find the Powers of the Crimson to battle the Maveriks. He set out alone to carry out the will of his surrogate father Zero who had passed away. Thus begins the Legend Of The Holy Robot Justice.&quot;\r<br />

It&#39;s too blasted hot, so I&#39;m glad I can watch SGDQ in the cool of my own home and donate to helping other people in the process. I&#39;d put this towards making the runner play _X7_, but since that&#39;s not an option, I guess we&#39;ll be putting more towards X6 because that&#39;s a different kind of suffering.

Popping in $10 for Romscout to play X6. If it gets through, there&#39;s another $3 in the wings for every boss defeated without dashing or damage taken. Violen&#39;s minimalist runs through the game have always been fascinating to watch, and i&#39;m curious how much having access to parts, armors, and weapons would trivialize the challenge.\r<br /> <br />-TheGamaniac

Hey guys, LLK here. I know my comment&#39;s long but I don&#39;t have many chances to donate, so I hope it gets read! <br /> <br />All of these runs have been utter madness. I don&#39;t quite comprehend how you people can utterly annihilate time and space in these games, but I&#39;m not ruling out magic.\r<br /> <br />Anyway, good luck to Sneaky and Romscout on their runs. I knew Sneaky back when he was an energetic kid who would jump onto a DDR machine and play Max 300 nine times in a row. So in case anyone was wondering, yes, he&#39;s always been a lunatic. <br /> <br />And I know Romscout from that time he and I went on an international jewel heist, in a quest to unite the pieces of an ancient crystal amulet in the hopes to save the world from an unspeakable evil. Oh stop making that face, Romscout, you know that totally happened. Don&#39;t deny it.\r<br /> <br />Romscout and Sneaky each get $10 towards whatever they want, OTHER THAN KILLING THE ANIMALS. But other than that, it can be anything. Seriously. If they want $10 towards making the rest of the marathon nothing but Earnest Evans speedruns, do it. If they want $10 towards shaving their names into SpikeVegeta&#39;s fro, it shall be done.\r<br /> <br />Keep being rad and make sure to hit all your sub-pixel-perfect-frameskip-out-out-bounds-damage-boost-jump-alpaca-screaming-tapdance-handstands... or whatever it is you guys do. I don&#39;t know all the lingo. Gimme a break.

Hey btw I recognize some of those people on the couch, some of them are sexy moderators, except the one on the right with the red shirt and SWAG haircut, he&#39;s a weird fellow. $50 for Super Metroid 100% because you can never have enough Zoast.

Hi all, unfortunately, at least from a selfish speedrun watching perspective, I&#39;ll be missing just about the whole marathon due to a wedding shoot that I&#39;m doing tomorrow, including most of the games that I wanted in particular to see. Good luck have Batman to all of you with your runs!

fun fact: the doctors without borders would save the animals. it&#39;s not a 100% run unless you do everything, including saving the animals. in metroid fusion it&#39;s shown that samus definitely saved the animals. have the fusion run quit right when you meet the animals if they&#39;re not saved, because they&#39;re not there (BECAUSE THEY DIED). <br /> <br />#ANIMALSAVE2013

Actually, since I did this before I heard about the $6K that went to Blueglass, I am being sneaky from work and changing this so it instead goes towards Watch Me Die difficulty on Doom 64.

Some say that if you play the song Holy Diver backwards, that you&#39;ll get the ROM data for the game. Or if you play the song through the mic input on the famicom, you can unlock Dio mode and play as Ronnie. Also, instead of everyone clapping at the end of the game, they should throw up the horns.

However, if someone can answer this question on stream correctly, they get to choose where it goes. No looking it up, you are on the honor system. Here&#39;s the question:\r<br />How many boss encounters are there in Final Fantasy 10? <br />( Don&#39;t announce this. here is the answer: 32. You are also on the honor system)

Keep up the amazing work, and continue to make me feel terrible. 15 toward Portrait of Ruin, and 15 to Blueglass is Best Final Fantasy. Or 30 to PoR, whichever is more allowed.

Here&#39;s the last of my expendable income, wish I could donate more to this great charity. Been looking forward to SGDQ all year since I missed AGDQ, and it&#39;s been well worth the wait. Loved DKCR and Luigi&#39;s Mansion yesterday.\r<br /> <br />Let Blueglass put this towards whatever he wants. Really, really looking forward to Ecco!\r<br /> <br />[if my comment is read use teronism as my name, thanks.]

And $5 for Super Metroid&#39;s take on Zero Suit Samus if it has one, otherwise put that towards having Auro as the file name in LttP

First time donating, and it&#39;s probably all I can do right now, so I wanted to make a donation that would lead to as many more as is possible! Since baiting fanboys = money, put my $20 towards &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; file name being &quot;Cloud Strife,&quot; or as much of that as will fit into the file name! If Link gets named Cloud OR if I get out-bid with donations, either way that&#39;s win-win and well worth $20, great job with these runs and I&#39;m glad you guys are putting your crazy talents to use for a crazy-good cause.

Hey guys, I don&#39;t have a whole lot to give at the moment like many others watching but I wanted to atleast give what I can to such an amazing cause. Have the runner 3 games from now choose whatever he wants this meager amount of money to go towards. Also Austin go to bed already, you have work tomorrow.\r<br /> <br />(Brossentia&#39;s Note: The runner is Bonesaw577)

Big shout outs to my main man K-Phoria. Everyone should look up Ghostbuster Luigi on YouTube if you enjoy seeing Luigi take on the ghouls of the Mushroom Kingdom. Also watch Luigi take on more obscure major villains such as The Shadow Queen and Cackletta. You will not be disappointed.

Hi there to all my friends. Sorry I couldn&#39;t be there to join you at SGDQ since I actually got a job and am making mad dolla dolla now. Good luck Boneswag and to everyone else in their runs. Quote from @GoldenSRL: &quot;Give theyetee their 1000 back.&quot; I don&#39;t think we should give their money back, but I really think those animals don&#39;t deserve to live. Always, always, always kill the animals.\r<br /> <br />With much love, spim with 420 m&#39;s.

Hey, Carcinogen! Great job with the speed run! I have only wrapped this game once and will never play it again because I found it too difficult. Seeing you speed run through takes me back! And it gives me a chance to experience one of my favorite games in my favorite series. Put this towards runner&#39;s choice. That&#39;s right, it&#39;s up to you bro! thanks again!

As a fellow Resident Evil speed runner and a zombie fanatic I&#39;m psyched about this run. If everyone high fives each other in the room (understand if the runner can&#39;t) I will donate another $5. Put this towards Sig&#39;s 16 Star run!

I&#39;ll unfortunately be unable to watch the run as I will have a 13 hour drive, but good luck puwexil!

Hey everyone. This is my first donation of the marathon, and it certainly won&#39;t be the last. I wanted to give a huge shout out to the runners, and everyone who makes these marathons possible. I&#39;m putting this money to the glitched run of Diddy Kong Racing, because I&#39;ve always wanted to see that game broken by the professionals.\r<br /> <br />Cheers!\r<br /> <br />MikotoIII

So, I have no idea what&#39;s going on in this game, but it looks pretty interesting. Here&#39;s $10 towards making someone suffer against That Boss in Metroid Fusion, and who do I have to smile sweetly at to put the other $15 towards not having any music at all during Dr Mario 64?\r<br /> <br />(And btw, there&#39;s a typo on the donation page. &quot;You may spslit your donation...&quot;)

This is a really great and enjoyable run to watch so far! Too bad you can&#39;t see Mr. Orange do the Konohana shuffle. I put $5 toward the Megaman X6 run, but I want to put $10 toward Scintilla to change the Karma Transformation to Beta Amaterasu, the regular white wolf one is too bland for this exciting marathon.

Hello SGDQ crew!\r<br />This is my first donation, and I am donating simply because of Blueglass being on camera. I can&#39;t donate much because I am poor, but I will try to donate again in the future!

Not sure what it is about it. I am scintilliaSD, have a big wolf and know how to speedrun. I could get green splits all day long, it&#39;s almost too easy.

Could you guys please put some more effort into the stream layout next time, this really hurts my eyes. It&#39;s bright green and the game is overlapping the webcam.\r<br /> <br />10 bucks to HLM DLC level.

You will need Him...Seriously...\r<br /> <br />2) YOU ARE THE BRUSH!!!! Keep that in mind, it&#39;s very important\r<br /> <br />3) Well, there is no n\xc2\xb03 actually so good luck with the run :-)\r<br /> <br />Love you guy&#39;s and once again good luck.\r<br /> <br />Nicolas Ziane A.K.A.
