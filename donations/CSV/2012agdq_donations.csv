The rear wall of the house rotted out and wind just blew through. I worked at McDonald&#39;s at the time, and the whole time I was sitting on the ratty old couch playing Quest 64 the guys I lived with were playing that &#39;Not Gonna Get Us&#39; song by TATU all day. And yet I came away from all that with fond memories of the game. So I&#39;m pretty sure it isn&#39;t a nostalgia thing. I missed the race at DOGathon and that made me feel really bad because I liked it. It makes me super happy to see it played here. So as we come up on the endgame of the run, all I have to say is Keep on sharkin&#39;."

Brian&#39;s Journey was basically Quest 64 but on the GBC and it was more finished. It had equipment and shops and characters like Leonardo and that warrior princess you rescue actually showed up repeatedly to say things and impact the plot. Also I forgot about Hybrid Heaven, that does make five RPGs. But honestly I mostly just want to watch somebody else suffer through Aidyn Chronicles."

I knew we would smash the donation, but I never thought we&#39;d be closing in on tripling it. I think we need a round of applause for all the donators, all 3116 at the time of this donation. Second, much appreciation to those in the chat who behaved themselves and were respectful throughout the marathon. It&#39;s never easy moderating a chat this big, and we had problems at times, but you all were a big help with keeping the +M off as much as possible. Round of applause for you. Finally, thanks to all the moderators and players who donated their time and energy for this event. Again, it&#39;s staggering to think we started two years ago with CGDQ, and here we are now. We&#39;d never have gotten this far without your commitment. Final round of applause goes to you. This is my last donation of the marathon, and I&#39;m putting it toward Counter kill for Sephiroth. See you all at the bonus streams, and then the next marathon. Maybe SGDQ2?"

Final Fantasy games relate to everyone in a unique way based on their personalities. Meaning no two people experience the game in the same way. So let&#39;s all agree that final fantasy games are the best period and here&#39;s to hoping the series can shine like it used to!"

"SteveTheDreamer",01/10/2012 04:15:28,"$30.00","Thank you to everyone who helped make this marathon such a success. My father and grandmother are both cancer survivors and it means alot to my family that you have raised so much money for a great cause. Also, my friend is a news reporter and recently did a story about a little girl who died of cancer at the age of only THIRTEEN. With over 140K$ raised for the Prevent Cancer Foundation hopefully this will help prevent things like that happening in the future. Also to anyone who ever said playing video games is a waste of time, you have proved them all wrong. I plan to see every marathon in the future and maybe even participate in one someday. Also: Is there anyone who runs Gain Ground on Sega Genesis? Possible for a Marathon?"

I had not heard of SDA before this and I have clearly been missing out! I checked out a few things in the archive the other day that I couldn&#39;t catch on the marathon. I particularly enjoyed the 100% run of super metroid, it was just beautiful! I have to add my vote for best FF is without a doubt FF6. Imo it does the best job melding the story, characters, locations, and music together. Narshe Mines, Figaro Castle, Phantom Forest, Devils Lab, Sealed Cave, Floating Continent, Atma... and that&#39;s only 1/2 the game. How can this not be #1!? Thank you ALL for such hard work making this event happen and congratulations on raising SO MUCH MONEY! Really shows what a positive force the gaming community can be!

My name is Myurieru(good luck pronouncing this name correctly, it is a japanese name! xD) on the chat. I must admit that It took me a long while to decide to donate some money considering things are tight. So, with the five dollars on my visa gift card I would like to donate it to this good cause. Plus the awesome stream has given me something to watch for a long while. Even if its just a few days ago that I discovered this SDA charity marathon for the first time. I am enjoying watching as much as I can. Keep up the great work and fight cancer! ^^; Also! Among the huge character list of the Touhou world, which ones are your favorites and why?"

I actually have a really awesome secret game in mind for next year, but getting my hands on the cartridge will be difficult. Mike Uyama throws a pretty rad party. Thanks also to everyone who made prizes, orchestrated the stream, read donations, worked behind the scenes, or simply played a great run. You guys raised a ridiculous amount of money and put on an &quot;awesome&quot; show. Quest 64 bonus stream? (Clearly the best Final Fantasy game.) As for me, it&#39;s back to various console and tool assisted runs in pursuit of the ever so evasive optimal run. Thanks for this pleasant interlude in the life of a speedrunner. See you next year~!"

Also, thanks for helping me prove once and for all that every single person that has played Final Fantasy VII before is physically compelled to click their fingers to the Turks theme during consequent runs and that I wasn&#39;t just insane for suggesting it."

Also Weapon Raid is such a great tune. This game is giving out massive nostalgy vibes to me (and a lot of others), it&#39;s pretty cool. Thanks for the great marathon, let&#39;s see more great marathons in the future. Until then, keep on saving those frames."

You guys should consider signing the SNES for the winner as it would become more valuable IMO. Im sure you can fit a lot of signatures on that thing. Also if you guys will not hug shirtless at the end, you should consider hugging the couch as it has been the real team player!"

And this definitely my last donation. Period. I have no money for anything now. Also this for Vince being named Brooks because he deserves a third chance and being a hero."

With that out of the way, this will probably make my final donation for the marathon, and what a ride it&#39;s been. I have to give congratulations to all the runners for all their speedruns. Also a big congratulations to all the donators due to the donations, what you guys have done is awesome, getting enough donations in this one marathon to not only surpass all of your 2011 marathons but also more than doubling last year&#39;s AGDQ, a very big acomplishment. Special thanks should also go to everyone who read off donations as well as all the techs who made sure the marathon streamed smoothly. While things didn&#39;t work out in regards to me getting SDA a dedicated IRC server for the chat, I am still honored to have been made a channel op and help moderate the chat when I was able to, and a big thanks to all the other ops as well. I can see now just how hard it is to keep upwards of 3000+ people under control. I hope that in the future, I have the time and money to join you all at one of these marathons and possibly have a run of my own. And since Breakdown is reading these, I have to say, all the donators are all the Man or Woman, whichever the case may be, for helping such a great cause as preventing cancer. Here&#39;s to more successful marathons!"

Someone mentioned earlier there had been a pretty good showing of genres in the marathon, but Strategy RPGs have been pretty underrepresented. It would be nice to see FFT, Tactics Ogre, or especially Fire Emblem in a future marathon. Keep it up guys, you&#39;re almost done."

I will teach you in my verse Sounds like corpse, corps, horse, and worse. I will keep you, Suzy, busy, Make your head with heat grow dizzy. Tear in eye, your dress will tear. So shall I! Oh hear my prayer. Just compare heart, beard, and heard, Dies and diet, lord and word, Sword and sward, retain and Britain. (Mind the latter, how it&#39;s written.) Now I surely will not plague you With such words as plaque and ague. But be careful how you speak: Say break and steak, but bleak and streak; Cloven, oven, how and low, Script, receipt, show, poem, and toe. Hear me say, devoid of trickery, Daughter, laughter, and Terpsichore, Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles, Exiles, similes, and reviles; Scholar, vicar, and cigar, Solar, mica, war and far; One, anemone, Balmoral, Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel; Gertrude, German, wind and mind, Scene, Melpomene, mankind. Billet does not rhyme with ballet, Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet. Blood and flood are not like food, Nor is mould like should and would. Viscous, viscount, load and broad, Toward, to forward, to reward. And your pronunciation&#39;s OK When you correctly say croquet, Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve, Friend and fiend, alive and live. Ivy, privy, famous; clamour And enamour rhyme with hammer. River, rival, tomb, bomb, comb, Doll and roll and some and home. Stranger does not rhyme with anger, Neither does devour with clangour. Souls but foul, haunt but aunt, Font, front, wont, want, grand, and grant, Shoes, goes, does. Now first say finger, And then singer, ginger, linger, Real, zeal, mauve, gauze, gouge and gauge, Marriage, foliage, mirage, and age. Query does not rhyme with very, Nor does fury sound like bury. Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth. Job, nob, bosom, transom, oath. Though the differences seem little, We say actual but victual. Refer does not rhyme with deafer. Foeffer does, and zephyr, heifer. Mint, pint, senate and sedate; Dull, bull, and George ate late. Scenic, Arabic, Pacific, Science, conscience, scientific. Liberty, library, heave and heaven, Rachel, ache, moustache, eleven. We say hallowed, but allowed, People, leopard, towed, but vowed. Mark the differences, moreover, Between mover, cover, clover; Leeches, breeches, wise, precise, Chalice, but police and lice; Camel, constable, unstable, Principle, disciple, label. Petal, panel, and canal, Wait, surprise, plait, promise, pal. Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair, Senator, spectator, mayor. Tour, but our and succour, four. Gas, alas, and Arkansas. Sea, idea, Korea, area, Psalm, Maria, but malaria. Youth, south, southern, cleanse and clean. Doctrine, turpentine, marine. Compare alien with Italian, Dandelion and battalion. Sally with ally, yea, ye, Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, and key. Say aver, but ever, fever, Neither, leisure, skein, deceiver. Heron, granary, canary. Crevice and device and aerie. Face, but preface, not efface. Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass. Large, but target, gin, give, verging, Ought, out, joust and scour, scourging. Ear, but earn and wear and tear Do not rhyme with here but ere. Seven is right, but so is even, Hyphen, roughen, nephew Stephen, Monkey, donkey, Turk and jerk, Ask, grasp, wasp, and cork and work. Pronunciation -- think of Psyche! Is a paling stout and spikey? Won&#39;t it make you lose your wits, Writing groats and saying grits? It&#39;s a dark abyss or tunnel: Strewn with stones, stowed, solace, gunwale, Islington and Isle of Wight, Housewife, verdict and indict. Finally, which rhymes with enough -- Though, through, plough, or dough, or cough? Hiccough has the sound of cup. My advice is to give up!"

I know 666\xc2\xa0bucks would be the right way to donate this amount, but I&#39;m a poor student, who can&#39;t afford that much .__. Loved Zelda LttP last marathon and am hoping to see similarly mind-blowing glitches as I witnessed in OoT. Also let me add that it&#39;s great to see WAK beat LUNK as a filename. Wak&#39;s speedruns were the first I saw on SDA (followed by TSA&#39;s OoT, only because I didn&#39;t have time right away to watch somthing five hours long). WAK is my personal Link to the Past (pun not intended ;)). I SHOULD be studying for an oral examination tomorrow at 9 a.m. (3 a.m. in your timezone), but I&#39;m not planning on missing a second of LttP. On another note, if I see this correctly, we are damn close to having collected more money in AGDQ12 than in all previous marathons put together! Can we have a round of applause for that? *LIKE!* On a final note, how about Tompa dowing a push-up for every frame he confirmedly lost? =D STOP READING HERE Put the money towards FFIX (9) as being the best Final Fantasy ever!"

I especially had to put in money for OOT, Majora&#39;s Mask, and Mario RPG. I&#39;ve never seen a full speed run of OOT and this is really blowing my mind here. I do have a question though, will a recording of this be uploaded later complete with the commentary included? It&#39;s fascinating to see the glitches and stuff explained along with the gameplay. I&#39;m new to this whole marathon thing so I&#39;m not sure how that works. Either way keep up the great work guys, this is awesome."

I was watching the Zelda 2 video from the first CGDQ, done by Breakdown, and someone made a comment that they would name everyone in FF6 Kefka if they got a donation for 1000$. After the whole Tifa debacle though, 1000$ feels so small! You guys have a great weekend, I&#39;ll be tuning in from time to time and definitely watching the recordings when they come out. Oh, and might as well invest in something. Money is going to Earthbound for the favorite food to be Cancer. I figure Ness should be chewing on it. Take care lads. Until the summer arrives!"

At some point we were told she had beaten it, but about a year later cancer came back somewhere else. At the young age of 14 we didn&#39;t have the emotional stability to deal with the fact that his mom would be passing away soon. At this very same time, my best friend got Final Fantasy 7.

"H..., MATTHEW",01/07/2012 21:28:00,"$300.00","Last year around this time of year I lost a close friend named Arthur not to cancer, but to heart disease. His family asked those close to him to donate instead of offering any condolences. I choose to donate to this charity not because of the cause, but because of those of you at SDA. Growing up, video games were forbidden by his parents. Having matured at an early age and being an eccentric who was never afraid to be himself, he had trouble making friends. We met 11 years ago in grade 9 and, after many visits after school, my friends and I exposed him to the magic of video games. He. Was. Awful. But he loved every second of it. He never felt ashamed whenever he crossed the finish line last or lost all his lives first. Over the next 10 years he would come to learn his way around a controller and when he moved out, even got an XBox of his own. He was blown away when he downloaded Portal (for free! Thanks Valve!) and it took away his entire weekend. It felt great to be able to chat with him about his experience with video games not as a mentor and a pupil, but as equals. It was around this time when he was taken from us. This is why I&#39;d like to make him a part of the world of video games one more time by naming Cloud in FF7 after him. Gone but not forgotten, this one&#39;s for you Arthur."

I&#39;ve been greatly enjoying the marathon, but this will have to be my last donation for monetary reasons (though I will keep watching to the end). As such, I&#39;d like to take this chance to sum up my thoughts. I&#39;ve absolutely loved this marathon, even more than the ones before it. Everyone has been so great and entertaining, both in terms of gameplay and commentary. I have loved SDA for years and fully support everything you are doing. I decided to donate during Super Metroid because it was the game that led me to SDA in the first place. Also, since it would be a waste to not put this towards something, put it towards Oracle of Seasons, since we&#39;ve seen Link&#39;s Awakening at previous marathons. There&#39;s so much more I would like to say, but I&#39;m not too good at putting my feelings into words, so I&#39;ll leave it here to keep from missing too much of the run. Good luck everyone. Let&#39;s all pitch in to help prevent cancer."

That was so... YEAH! Wasn&#39;t it so neat how you could, like, ride in like a giant mobile-suit armor and like punch stuff? Aww man, Wasn&#39;t it the bomb getting the Street Fighter Hadoken and then like trashing Vile in like one hit? Like &quot;BAM! All that stress you gave me in the first level, I don&#39;t even care!&quot; Wasn&#39;t it cool how like Storm Eagle&#39;s stage was, like, it wasn&#39;t even, like, in, like a box room, it was like outside on an airship and you were like &quot;HOLY CRAP he&#39;s flying around, where is he!?&quot; Wasn&#39;t it cool that if you decided to skip getting the mobile-suit armor, then if you just walk forwar as regular X, the other enemies that are in mobile-suit armors, they&#39;re actually OUTSIDE their mobile-suit armors so you get like a chance to kinda, like, stand a chance against them &#39;cause they&#39;re hard, right? And if you kill them before they go into their mobile-suit, you can steal it, and it&#39;s... GOD IT&#39;S BRILLIANT! You know how the last boss sigma is really hard even if you have full subtanks? So you use up all your subtanks and then you die and you&#39;re like &quot;Well crap, now i don&#39;t even stand a chance because I couldn&#39;t even beat him before with 4 subtanks&quot; But the level before going up to sigma has these infinitely spawning caterpillars that you can just kill with Armored Armadillo&#39;s charged thing, and you can just stand there and be like &quot;BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!&quot; and just kill them and then your subtanks get filled up in like a second and then you can beat sigma again, IT&#39;S BRILLIANT!

There&#39;s been a lot of marathon&#39;s I&#39;ve wanted to donate for, but lacked funds to do so, and even though this amount is small, I&#39;m glad it&#39;s contributing to the bigger picture. Here&#39;s hoping our next speedrun involves defeating cancer for good! Looking forward to seeing many speedruns, and matching faces to streamers I watch. Good luck to everyone and fight for the great cause. Thanks, Brad. P.S. If romscout ever remembers &quot;Trooper&quot; from the Megaman X1-X6 race from Speedrunslive, my nick was AlteisenX and I ran MMX4 and my best time is 57:04.

"SN64",01/05/2012 01:22:37,"$200.00","The timing of this charity marathon is now completely uncanny from my perspective. On December 18th, 2011, my grandmother Ardelle passed away at the age of 79 from Mantle-Cell Lymphoma. This super aggressive cancer took her life a mere three days after we had any indication that something was seriously wrong. She was feeling a little fatigued but otherwise alright earlier that week, so she went to the doctor on Wednesday, December 14th. We got the call that night that she needed to be hospitalized immediately. By Thursday, her white blood cell count had jumped up to 120,000 (normal is 12k). By Friday, that count had jumped up to 196k. By Saturday, any idea of attempting chemotherapy or hope for recovery was gone, and then she was gone less than an hour into Sunday, December 18th. While the suddenness of the whole situation was hard to take in, I am only thankful that, in the end, she passed quickly and peacefully, rather than going through the months of suffering that her husband - my grandfather - went through due to lung cancer four years ago. I&#39;m not telling you all this to garner pity or sympathy. My grandmother wouldn&#39;t want that. She was a strong, kind woman and a breast cancer survivor of 9 years. She outlived her husband and many of her closest friends, yet she still managed to live an independent and active life all the way to the very end. Instead, I wanted to make this initial donation as a way of honoring her memory while also demonstrating how cancer can have both a lasting impact and a devastatingly fast impact on the lives of the afflicted and their loved ones. I hope that anyone who is on the fence about donating to the Prevent Cancer Foundation might reflect on this account and others like it and be convinced to donate what they can during the SDA marathon. - Shayne \xc3\xa2??SN64\xc3\xa2?? Hill P.S. Please put my $200 toward making Mike Uyama torture himself with Sub-Terrania for everyone&#39;s amusement."
