I have a 10 year old cousin who is afflicted with autism, and the initiatives that you all have taken in supporting charities like this will help to see that he has a brighter and happier future. Many of us start as complete strangers at the SDA marathons, but since we each have a deep personal history in video games, it&#39;s almost as if we have shared those past experiences together, and can reflect upon them as if we had always been friends. It&#39;s an amazing thing, and it&#39;s the main reason I attend these events. Mushy stuff aside, Here&#39;s some sponduli towards sniping Locke&#39;s name in FF6 to be &quot;Duck&quot;.

I am a teacher primarily for students on the Autistic-spectrum, and I think everything you&#39;re doing for them is amazing. I&#39;m also a big nerd and like to hack videogames, FF6 in particular, so seeing it as this year&#39;s finale is really something special. I have used the game and it&#39;s hacking tools as both learning tool and reward for my students, so it seems appropriate that I donate more than I ever have in years past! My one-on-one student, Carr&#39;s, favorite character is Locke, and he always thinks it&#39;s funny to name him &quot;Thief&quot;, so I&#39;d like to make my donate to see him get that name in your finale run this year.

"P..., David",05/28/2012 08:37:49,"$5.00","(Pardon my long-windedness.) Hey guys, Silver_Skree here. I&#39;ve been watching since late Friday night, and I thought I&#39;d drop a few bucks for the good cause and to show my support. I&#39;m sad I missed J&#39;s KDL3 run, and I offer my condolences for the final boss of Shinobi (Although the UltraJPanic going on during the rest of that run as a result of Maximum Sleepy Mode was the funniest thing). I&#39;ve been greatly enjoying the stream; the lineup this time was golden, but I&#39;m also sad that my body forced me to miss the Gaia games just to get some shuteye. I&#39;m doing whatever it takes to stay awake for FFVI though; I&#39;m super hyped for it. Also, I&#39;ve got a few questions about how the events are organized. Firstly, whose house is this hosted at, and how beastly is the internet connection there? Secondly, do you host the event at this location every year when possible or does the location change? I ask because I&#39;d love to be able to attend one of these, but I live in Alabama and there&#39;s no way I can afford the plane tickets. Thirdly, do you guys get hotel rooms or do you sleep in-house? If the latter, how big is the house? Do each of you have to bring sleeping bags or something? In any case, major props to all the other organizers and supporters like chat mods, people making prizes, and all the runners themselves. It takes both parties to make this possible, and I think I can safely say each one loves it. It feels like this really makes a difference, with the event consistently pulling in tens of thousands of dollars, and I&#39;m proud to be a supporter. Keep doing what you do, and as for the $5, I&#39;ll let J decide what to do with it. P.S.: For all the other people in the chat, is anyone else irked by OCD due to the XSplit regions always being *slightly* off? Like, the G in &quot;Game:&quot; is always a little bit cut off and such... P.P.S.: Oh, and also, if this $5 is enough to enter me into any raffles running right now, just re-draw if I win. I have too many doo-dads lying around my house already; whatever I won would just get lost. Yes, that goes for the Grand Prize too."

First let me say I really wish I could&#39;ve been there, and it looks like you all are having a grand old time at the essentiafour H Center. And really, you guys are doing fantastic. UA&#39;s got the tech stuff down, commentary is informative and entertaining, and the quality of play has been great the whole way through. Hats off to all of you, really, and don&#39;t lose sight of the great thing you&#39;re all doing. Tens of thousands of dollars for a great charity is something to be immensely proud of. I know you&#39;re all having a blast, but you&#39;re also doing great work. Keep up both going down the home stretch. Also shouts outs to all the non attendees making this thing awesome. The plushie makers, the perler crafter, the picture drawers, the shirt designers, the channel moderators, the stream chatters, the elive-ers, the shark enthusiasts, the SA contingent, the Bronies (yes, you too), and any other group I may have forgotten at this time. Without all of you this event wouldn&#39;t have quite the same flavor of awesome, and I wouldn&#39;t want it any other way. But most importantly thanks to all the donors who&#39;ve opened their wallets or paypal or bank accounts or what have you to support an awesome cause in OAR. You are all the man, or the wo-man if that is indeed the case. With that said, been looking forward to the Zelda block immensely, and here&#39;s to hoping DW, Feasel, and Kubelwagon knock their respective runs out of the park. Best of luck to the 3 of you and all the runners on deck afterwards. Lastly, let&#39;s put this $5 to naming Setzer BD. I&#39;m aware this will need some help to get through, but he was always my favorite in FF6 even before I knew he was broken, so if you people in internet land see fit to help this along it&#39;d put a smile on my face. Keep on rocking guys and I&#39;ll see you in January for AGDQ2013."

I managed to finish in 2:03:01, getting a REALLY lucky Nightmare fight (he circled me almost the entire fight, died on his second approach to the ladder, right in my face, first try. And then I go on to die against Ridley FIVE TIMES. The hardest parts, of course, are the significantly less difficult parts. I died probably 2x as many times as you did, but mainly BECAUSE I did faster, less cautious strategies, so it seemed to have evened out. Double core shots helped a lot. See you next mission. -JaggerG PS: Think you can go for the Pogo Omega Metroid bug in a bonus stream later or something?"

"Bingham, Mike (Mister Bing)",05/25/2012 03:22:48,"$10.00","Oh holy crap the end of that Portal run was amazing. Zimbabwe is a freak of nature! Please use this ten bucks in combination with my previous ten bucks to rename Locke in FF6. Locke&#39;s pretty useless, and really kind of a dweeb, he goes all white knight on every female he meets, and every female he meets has terrible things happen to them. His only redeeming feature is that he&#39;s friends with a seriously cool guy who happens to have a twin brother. He does have nice hair though. For these reasons and more, Locke&#39;s name MUST be changed to Otacon. Great work so far, loving every minute of this!"
