Is it possible that the teleport from the Hoover have that same value when you done a &quot;la&quot; spell that sets you on specific areas of battle backgrounds and stops at the area where the Hoover can appear cause the game might think it does the right option when it have a value that matched with the teleport setting and stops then the fight cause it trigger the battleend and places you to that spot where you might appear ? When this theory is already disproved then sry for the announcer to read this crap :D\r<br />However I also wanted to say its awesome to see you guys having so mutch fun by playing a game over and over again with so mutch love and patience and its also awesome to do it simultaneously for such a great and amazing cause so thank you for all what you do and haveing done already you guys are incredible <br />bye bye "

I do have a question that Essentia or Puwexil could answer after hearing the parameters of the current run. Considering that this run is Joker Doom &amp; Vanish Doom etc. free, I would like to know the protocol for Wrexsoul in Doma castle, considering the common way of going about defeating him is Vanish/X-Zone.

As a long time fan of FF6, seeing this speedrun live is an awesome experience. I read an article on SDA about Essentia&#39;s 2007 run and have since wanted to see it on a GDQ marathon live. I do have a question that Essentia or Puwexil could answer after hearing the parameters of the current run. Considering that this run is Joker Doom &amp; Vanish Doom etc. free, I would like to know the protocol for Wrexsoul in Doma castle, considering the common way of going about defeating him is Vanish/X-Zone. Good luck guys! Until AGDQ15, I bid farewell. "

But I&#39;m a genetic freak, and I&#39;m not normal, so you got a 25% at best at beatin&#39; me! And then you add Kurt Angle to the mix? Your chances of winnin&#39; drasticy go down. <br /> <br />See the three-way, at Sacrifice, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winnin&#39;. But I, I got a 66 2/3 chance of winning, cause Kurt Angle KNOWS he can&#39;t beat me, and he&#39;s not even gonna try! <br /> <br />So, Samoa Joe, you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus my 25 percent chance, and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winnin&#39; at Sacrifice! But then you take my 75 perchance chance at winnin&#39;, if we was to go one-on-one, and to add 66 2/3 ch\xe2\x80\xa6 percents, I got a 141 2/3 chance of winnin at Sacrifice! <br /> <br />See, McJoe; the numbers don&#39;t lie, and they spell disaster for you at Sacrifice!\r<br /> <br />- &#39;Big Poppa Pump&#39; Scott Steiner"

It might do something like cause the sketch glitch to happen long before you guys get Relm! This might be my last donation for the marathon, but I&#39;ve been known to lie about this before. SGDQ 2014 has been very fun to watch and very successful, so congrats to basically everyone.

"Kojakt",06/29/2014 02:16:12,"$50.00","Hey people. Was hoping I could share my story... I started watching #gdq on YouTube in dec 2013. I eventually found myself watching Carl Sagan&#39;s 2013 Y.I. run Every Single Day for about 3 months. I was consumed by the enthusiasm, passion, and joy that everyone on stream had for this speedrun. After more exploring, I found a run by Trihex in which he spoke of the &quot;jogging&quot; type of running and how he got in shape. By this time, I was inspired by each speedrunner I&#39;d seen. Their dedication and determination made any task seem possible. Since then, I&#39;ve lost 40 pounds by jogging every other morning and eating right. Today, purely by coincidence, I quit smoking after 15 and a half years, and I&#39;m 100% certain it&#39;s for real, but it never would have happened had it not been for all of the events that have transpired between when I saw Carl&#39;s run and now. With any luck (RNG), this community of speedrunners has prevented cancer in me. Not through donations, which are incredible and amaze me every time, but through your passion, kindness, and, most of all, inclusiveness. (In my case, especially Golden, Sinister and Kottpower) Thank you SO much! With that said, if those animals want to get off the planet, let them catch a ride with spore spawn. #GDQforever!"

It was one of the best memories of my childhood. <br />I remember his mother passing by and saying: &quot;let him play more often&quot;, and I always replied: &quot;I&#39;m fine, I just like watching&quot;.\r<br />And here I am now.

Who are these 4 Pokemon?\r<br /> <br />Answer: Same sound is Machop and Omanyte. Similar is Ditto and Poliwag.\r<br /> <br />Keep up the amazing work with these runs. Oh and Gotta Kill &#39;Em All. The run is more important."

This Mario block is the most wonderful showcase of the series I&#39;ve seen, and Super Mario World holds a special place in my heart as my favorite of the series.

You see, we have a slightly different timescale. But to make things simple, I am writing from the year 49,170 AD."

I amazed how fast you can guys do these speed runs and being able to remember anything what comes ahead. I know my Donation is little but I want to give little help to all of you amazing speed runners and of course to you amazing commentator in the background. Also I don&#39;t know if this is the fastest time of this old game called Metroid Fusion. But my time is 2 hours and 4 minutes. So if anyone wants to challenge me go ahead I take you on and ROCK ON GUYS BEAT THOSE SPEED RUN TIMES!"

I know you&#39;re a speedrunner, not an opera floozy, but I have every faith in you.\r<br /> <br />Out of curiosity, what language and/or translation is going to be used?

It is perhaps the most useful yeast, having been instrumental to winemaking, baking, and brewing since ancient times. It is believed that it was originally isolated from the skin of grapes (one can see the yeast as a component of the thin white film on the skins of some dark-color fruits such as plums; it exists among the waxes of the cuticle). It is one of the most intensively studied eukaryotic model organisms in molecular and cell biology, much like Escherichia coli as the model bacterium. It is the microorganism behind the most common type of fermentation. S. cerevisiae cells are round to ovoid, 5\xe2\x80\x9310 micrometres in diameter. It reproduces by a division process known as budding."

However, I think the speedrunning and fighting game community are brothers in arms when it comes to using frames to your advantage.

My sleeping schedule is destroyed already and won&#39;t get any better since most stuff I want to watch is in the middle of the night for me.\r<br /> <br />Putting this money towards Bionic Commando 100%, since I&#39;ll be running Rearmed 100% at ESA!\r<br /> <br />And I&#39;m pretty sure you people still have one unused chance to get the other half of that donation from AGDQ bonus stream that involves getting my name right. Just sayin&#39;.\r<br /> <br />Cheers!"

Been a fan of your marathons for a couple years, I just always forget the dates.\r<br /> <br />I just wanted to thank you all for everything you have done. Everyone says what a fantastic job you all have done on helping people. While they&#39;re right, I wanted to point out something else you all have done: Created what is possibly the best community in gaming.\r<br /> <br />The speed run community is competitive, but never unhealthy in that competition. They&#39;re one of the most cooperative groups I&#39;ve ever seen. How many shout outs do we get to runners or even just general gamers who have discovered tips and tricks, or helped with routing and optimization? They&#39;re so welcoming and open to new people who are interested in joining in.\r<br /> <br />So congrats, you guys. Not just for helping people all over the world with your charity drives, but for showing everyone just how good a gaming community can be."

I think you all do wonderful things, and as a gamer/aspiring designer... It&#39;s nice to see something that goes AGAINST the narrative often shown that gamers are all antisocial shut-ins who are just a twitch away from shooting people. I like things that give me faith in humanity, like you all do here. There are a lot of terrible things in the world, and all the news plays is everything that goes wrong, people shooting each other, people hating each other, people killing each other, people who need help not getting it... And you guys... all of you, give me a ray of hope that maybe... just maybe... we&#39;re not all screwed after all. Thank you all, for doing what you do, and for showing that gamers are people too, and more often than not?

I found your speed runs from the Blindfolded Super Punchout run. And sense then I been constantly going over the old runs and found the long replay of the AGDQ, and must say it helps me sleep at night with the sound of the game play and talking going on. So here is to having this on all night long for the long run.\r<br /> <br />This is to Ecco it was always a fun game. And to hoping for a good long marathon and a helping out to a good charity"
