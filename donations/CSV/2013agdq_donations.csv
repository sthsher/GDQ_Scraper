I&#39;m sure beating the elite four is beyond your wildest dreams, so let&#39;s just keep it right there. Forget about the crowds, their fancy uniforms, and remember what got you here. Focus on the fundamentals that we&#39;ve gone over time and time again. And most important, don&#39;t get caught up thinking about winning or loosing this game. If you put your effort and concentration into playing to your potential, to be the best that you can be, I don&#39;t care what the scoreboard says at the end of the game, in my book Werster is a winner!"

Don&#39;t want to see my little buddy there with a frown. Just because RunngerGuy gets more donations than you, well that&#39;s only because they don&#39;t know you like I do. Sure, you&#39;re weedy and kind of shy. But some donators out there must be needy for a weedy, shy guy. They want you as the needle when they&#39;re rolling in the hay. Just hear me out when I say... Mirrored, you got it going on. The donators will get to know your sexuality when they get to know your personality. I said, Mirrored, you got it going on. Not in a gay way, just in a &quot;hey mate, I wanted to say that you&#39;re looking okay, mate.&quot; -O&#39;Sh"

It&#39;s because the game runs vertical collision checks on normal levels on Mario&#39;s left and right bottom pixel, but on slope levels it only checks his middle bottom pixel. So you don&#39;t have a front foot to get stuck in the wall far enough to jump; you only have a &quot;middle&quot; foot, so you&#39;d need to be already moving more than 8 pixels per frame to get far enough in the wall to walljump in a slope level."

Not only am I a survivor (twice!), but today is an especially somber day for me, as it marks the 10th year that I have been without my &#39;mum&#39;, who, because of melanoma, left this world far too early. She was a fantastic woman, and she taught me so much, and I try to life my life by her example. I miss her more than words exist in any language to say.<br /><br />I just want to say thank you, to each and every one of you who have donated, and to each and every one of you making this marathon happen. Your generosity never ceases to amaze me, what you&#39;re all doing is absolutely incredible. Hopefully together we can all erradicate this horrible disease. Much love from Canada.<br /><br />=====<br /><br />Also, I pledge to donate $5 for each unique person who smokes Mike Uyama in the back of the head in the next five minutes (someone, please keep count). Mike&#39;s an awesome person, so this is just for funsies. But, who doesn&#39;t want to smoke the dictator in the back of the head ;)"

Some years ago- never mind how long precisely- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people&#39;s hats off- then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me."

Happy new year! :)\r<br />I found the ChipIn a bit early on your Twitch page, so I decided to take an headstart by being the first donator of AGDQ 2013. Like I did in SGDQ 2012 :) <br />This $40 donation will be for having Ratchet &amp; Clank in French language, because once again, there is a French commentary for the live streaming! This time it will happen on Millenium.org, which has a liveTV and it will rebroadcast the whole event. So mistermv, Aelthan, Mynthos and many casters, including me, will comment the runs in Moli\xc3\xa8re&#39;s language. And I will comment the Ratchet &amp; Clank run by the way :)\r<br />And rest assured, a ton of donations will come from us! We all love that initiative you took three years ago, and we hope we&#39;ll help you to go even farther this year. <br /> <br />Long live AGDQ! Longue vie \xc3\xa0 AGDQ !\r<br />And remember people, runners, donators, watchers...\r<br />YOU ARE ALL THE MAN! (and WOMAN of course :D)"
