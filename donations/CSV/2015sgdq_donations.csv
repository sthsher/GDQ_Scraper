This 7 day event has been a black hole for all my free time this week, as i have found myself lost in an obsessive binge watch. New games, old games and even classic games have been played before my eyes by some of the greatest gamers i have ever scene, and it is all to raise money for Doctors Without Borders. I hoped to see these donations pass one million and am happy to say they went a large amount passed. I am truly astounded by this event and thrilled that I got to be a part of the amazing gaming, even if only from my computer screen. Thank you!!!"

Do you guys have any suggestions as to where I can get one? And Chrono Trigger too? I&#39;ve really wanted to run this game since AGDQ of last year!

"Blucham",08/02/2015 05:34:27,"$25.00","Guys, I&#39;ve never beat Chrono Trigger before, but have heard many tales of it being one of the greatest games ever. Growing up on SNES games like FF2, I knew it would be worth giving a shot. I bought it for DS, and have VERY slowly made my way through it over the past few months. Took me a while to warm up to it, wondering what&#39;s the big deal? I was worried I had grown into a jaded old grump. But last night I got the Masamune and entered Magus&#39; castle for the first time... I just couldn&#39;t put it down! The story, artwork, music, and even fight style with new combo attacks blew me away! Plot twists and character revelations have never been so engaging for me. I used a rare and precious day off to play all the way up to getting Magus on my team. <br /> <br />I only heard of your event after posting about my new found love for this game on Facebook today. WHAT A COINCIDENCE!!! I can&#39;t believe how quickly you&#39;ve been breezing through what took me so long. Your dedication to dissecting this game so intimately is certainly a testament to how awesome it is, even though I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not telling you anything new.\r<br /> <br />I will NOT be watching this stream to the end, as I want to experience the rest for myself, pure and true. Sorry y&#39;all! I&#39;m a day late, but not a dollar short to pitch in a donation. Aloha from Hawaii!\r<br />"

My favorite moments have been the insane tetris block, Henneko_&#39;s endless optimism in the face of bad RNG, and the wildly unpredictable races. RNGesus has been unkind to a lot of the runners and they&#39;ve faced it with determination in the name of this awesome cause. I got chills when the cheers went up for 1 million raised. This marathon has also helped me to bond with my 11 year old cousin, who loves seeing games broken, and tonight we&#39;re both staying up late to watch Chrono Trigger together, one of my favorite games when I was 11, and one he really wants to play now. Thank you to the runners, the staff and crew and everyone who has donated their time and effort to this amazing event. Keep on breaking games, saving frames, and helping lives. GDQ HYPE!

Speedrunning is not just about beating games fast, it is also about breaking limits, unlocking hidden potential, and about growth and improvement. GDQ&#39;s show that the improvement is not just of PB&#39;s, but a way to entertain and save the world in more than just games! <br /> <br />Thank you everyone, staff, crowd, donators, and runners for all that you do, and THANK YOU for another great GDQ! We blew away old records, for sure! Many hours of sleep were lost, excitement never died, much pizza was dined on, shirts were bought, and a great time was had for sure!\r<br /> <br />Plus, we saved the animals again. I can diggit."

"McKenzie, Michael (mike89)",08/02/2015 04:00:36,"$10.00","We often get lots of heartfelt stories this time of year, and I think I&#39;ll share one of my own. It involves around 20 altruistic gamers, who, five years ago, took a few consoles, a basement, and a stream that felt like it was held together with duct tape at times, and raised over $11,000 in the first weekend of 2010. None of us could ever have dreamed that, five years later, it would become a professional fundraising behemoth, raising over $5 million for worthy charities in that time frame, drawing over a thousand passionate people to the event and a few hundred thousand more to watch! <br /> <br />So while a few of those initial twenty are still going strong at these events, including, of course, the lovely lady wrecking shop on Chrono Trigger right now, one of those twenty is sitting back in Australia on a Sunday afternoon with a goofy grin on his face, full of pride at what was set in motion way back then.

I&#39;m amazed not only by the massive amounts of money raised, not only by the incredible gaming skill on display, but also by the people present, how friendly and supportive of each other everyone is. Just wandering around, you can see people playing games, working together on new runs, or improving strats for existing games, or maybe just talking and having a good time, all while donating a week (not counting all the work the staff and runners put in outside of the marathon itself) to great causes like MSF and PCF.

That includes the runners, the donation station, the hosts, the tech station, the rest of the GDQ staff, everyone in the chats, all the donors and viewers. As for where to put this donation towards, $Z0 for having her hug Crono because that pairing just makes more sense to me compared to Crono and Lucca, $20 to get the Epoch ending because time travel.

Or that zero star run from a few minutes ago? Classic. <br /> <br />As we wrap up our time together, it&#39;s important to remember something. No matter if you broke a world record, or your personal best. If you watched the whole marathon or are just dropping by to see what the fuss is about. Even if you&#39;re a hardcore speed runner or a filthy casual, remember that this is something special. <br /> <br />This is about humans coming together to do something really neat for other humans. The people that Doctor&#39;s without Boarders are helping probably aren&#39;t watching right now. You more then likely don&#39;t know the people any of the people you&#39;re helping, but you&#39;re still doing it. Cause you&#39;re pretty great. The runners are great. The staff is great. The people donating are great. <br /> <br />And THAT&#39;S great. In a world of sometimes really unfortunate things, this event shows that humans can also do some pretty nifty things.\r<br /> <br />So let&#39;s push through the last few hours of this event and keep doing good things. <br /> <br />All the best,\r<br /> <br />Mavia.\r<br /> <br />P.S. - My donation is going towards saving the animals because who doesn&#39;t love a good horse race? $300,000 for a few pixels? Less than $500 separating? That can&#39;t be real. "

Wind Waker still holds up to date and remains one of the best 3D Zelda experiences of all time. Good luck to Chaotic_Ace in subbing 4 hours and can&#39;t wait for Shadow of the Colossus afterwards.\r<br /> <br />SGDQ has been a great help over the past week in dealing with the loss of my beloved canine companion. I miss you Scamp but I know you&#39;ve gone right to doggie heaven. It&#39;s still hard to wake up and realize you&#39;re no longer here, but as I tell me own viewers: If life is giving you a hard day, never be afraid to eat your pudding with a fork. Because of all of the love you gave me in our twelve years together I can put this towards nothing less than saving the animals.

Your logistics is really impressive, thanks to everyone who participated in this amazing event, from far and near. We support you from the French restream, thanks to mistermv and the whole team who deal with this restream! I would like to put this donation to rename Crono as Dzo in Chrono Trigger. Dzoan Ho is an amazing artist who takes part in every &#39;GDQ event whether by drawing doodles or by drawing the art of The Yetee t-shirts, so we want to pay tribute to him. <br />Thank you for your devotion."

You guys do an amazing job!\r<br /> <br />Kirby Super Star is one of my favorite games from my childhood and it&#39;s very important to me for one specific reason: One day, in the middle of a playing session on my old SNES, I was playing Kirby along with the most beautiful girl on earth: Michelle. She asked me to be her boyfriend and I immediately said yes. That day was exactly 5 years ago and we have been happily together ever since. I love her very much and I really hope that I can share my life with her.\r<br /> <br />Gaming has always been a hobby that brings enormous happiness to everyone around it. It&#39;s awesome to see what the power of the community can do for such a noble cause.

It&#39;s great to see how much it&#39;s grown over the years and how much it&#39;s benefiting great causes.\r<br /> <br />Mega Man X has been my favorite series since I was a kid. X2 actually gave me comfort when my grandmother lost her battle with cancer. Keep up the great work and y&#39;all have a good one.\r<br /> <br />P.S. Money goes to kill the animals.

I used to speed run Super Metroid before I even knew what speedrunning was, although the current runners are way better than I ever was.
