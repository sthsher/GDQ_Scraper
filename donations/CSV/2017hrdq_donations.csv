"CaptainKefka",09/03/2017 10:39:18,"$15.00","Fellow Houstonian here. Got back yesterday from a drive to Austin after having to pick up my parents from the airport there. Their flights back home had all been canceled so it was the only real option, but I&#39;m just glad they&#39;re back safe. Despite being locked in my home for a week, I&#39;m fortunate to say that I&#39;m okay, but because I live on a bayou many of my neighbors were flooded badly and some family members were temp evacuated late in the evening. After settling down after this week of unbearable stress this GDQ gives me hope for the 1 million displaced in my home state. Things won&#39;t ever be the same driving downtown, but I know the people here and we&#39;ll get through it together. Thank you for this. Much love and good luck on the runs everyone."

"Frazer, Braden (Braden Frazer)",09/03/2017 00:43:53,"$25.00","Hi from Houston! As an avid watcher of GDQs for the last two years, the support of the community for our city means so much and it has been incredible to see $100,000 already raised in just 24 hours. While my family was very fortunate to not get any flooding in our area of southeast Houston, I have plenty of friends and family who weren&#39;t as lucky and can definitely use the help. Thanks to all the GDQ staff and runners for getting this event together so quickly - this is a very special GDQ for me and the others in our city."

I&#39;m timing this donation to come right before the Doom run, as that is one of the first video games I ever played, and it holds a special place in my heart, much like GDQ, and much like the city of Houston, where I have lived for 4 years now.

The other half goes to runners choice because playing video games fast and raising money for Houston is more important than doing summer work. Lets get some gold !"

This event is amazing and I felt that I had to do at least a little to help out. Shout outs to my roommate who is sleeping right now because he is going to wake up at 5am to drive down to Houston with his Church to help out our fellow Texans! Best of luck to all runners and our friends down in Houston. "
